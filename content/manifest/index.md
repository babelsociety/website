Although the universe is incomprehensibly vast, we know only one planet where life has managed to flourish: the Earth.

Nonetheless, many think that it is not suitable anymore: too many people, too many problems. Colonize Mars if you want to make your existence truly meaningful!

What we lack is perhaps introspection, a better understanding of ourselves. We are fortunate to exist on one of the best planets in the known universe. Having a life that is often difficult, full of injustices and problems that tend to crush us is not due to *where* we are, but rather to **what kind** of society surrounds us. Society that we ourselves have created. Problems that arise from within ourselves.

Just as we cannot be comfortable with others until we solve the problems we carry within, we will not be able to fully enjoy all the beauty that surrounds us until we have improved the society we live in.

We can do it.

Babel Society wants to propose a new type of society and a [concrete plan](@/plan/index.md) to achieve it.

We are aware that changing an entire society from one day to the other is impossible, the project aims instead to create a small starting community where we test and prove our ideas.

Babel Society doesn't seek a _revolution_, but rather a genuine **evolution**.


# Key Concepts

Each aspect of Babel Society stems from the following key concepts:

- Collaboration
- Authenticity
- Freedom
- Stability

This Manifest is in no way set in stone, it is subject to revision in each and every part, however we believe these key concepts will transcend time and stay always relevant as long as humans will be around.


## Collaboration

We believe that collaboration is the most important principle, the basis of every efficient group and successful endeavor. Collaboration means knowing how to play together, joining forces in order to achieve a goal that alone we could never achieve.  
It means recognizing the value of others, accepting and respecting them; to stake one's own interests so that others can benefit from them.  
Collaboration means that everyone can express their opinions without fear of repercussions, favoring dialog until more efficient solutions are found.

**Collaboration does not apply only between humans, but must be extended to the whole world around us**. We must therefore learn to coexist with other species, to respect and protect the different biomes present in the world. We must understand that being in harmony with nature is fundamental for the long-term survival of any species, humans included.


## Authenticity

Each person is as similar as they are different from any other. The similarities help us find points of contact with others, while the diversities give us strength, they help us see the world under a different light, to give birth to ideas that alone we would never have.

Just think of all the different species of animals present in nature, each with a peculiarity that makes them necessary for the functioning of the whole.

Being able to be authentic means above all to feel accepted and to accept ourselves, a primary necessity for one's sanity. Have you ever tried to live by pretending to be different? It is more common than people think and not just among minorities.

If everyone accepted their neighbor, then it goes without saying that there could be no hatred and prejudices related to race, to a physical peculiarity, to religion and so on. A hate-free society is a much more efficient and positive society.

**We want everyone to feel normal about being themselves**.


## Freedom

Freedom is a fundamental concept to be able to fully enjoy our life. There can be no true freedom in a society where there are conflicting groups and divisions, much less if there are strict hierarchies. Any hierarchy of power assumes that there are people who are superior to others, which undermines the freedom of those considered inferior.  
For this reason Babel Society wants to abolish all forms of hierarchy of power within its society.

Freedom means that any person in society is free to associate with whomever they wish, including people outside the society itself. It also means we will be free to use our time as we see fit and have a job that we are happy to do.


## Stability

Any organism needs a stable system to grow, but this is particularly important for us human beings, who are often too forward-thinking. The ability to design our tomorrow is among the unique features we have in respect to the whole animal kingdom, but to be used efficiently we need strong pillars that we can rely on. Uncertainty is often a source of stress and prevents society from functioning fruitfully.

We shouldn't confuse "stability" with "stasis". A system in stasis assumes that development stopped, everything is at a standstill. The stability we are referring to is instead the resistance to unexpected impulses, **a system that is able to move forward towards the set goal even when facing serious, unexpected challenges**.

No matter how many good intentions and qualities we arm ourselves with, perfection is not of this world. Mistakes are always on the agenda, which is why it is very important to know how to manage them.


# Technology

At the heart of Babel Society is a technological revolution that aims to give as much visibility and power as possible to every member of society.

Each technological component will be created following the philosophy of [Free Open Source Software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software), which is one of the most successful forms of collaboration. This means that:

- Every detail of the system can be scrutinized by anyone
- Every part will be usable and modifiable by anyone
- Everyone can contribute to the improvement of it

Over the years it has been shown that the technologies thus developed tend to be among the safest and most reliable as they are for all to see, and it is therefore more likely that flaws or incorrect behaviors will be identified and corrected.

Technology advancement becomes an ally that can improve our lives rather than making them worse.

All technologies as well as being free will have to be as decentralized as possible. We aim for a distributed infrastructure in which every member holds a piece of the puzzle. This characteristic will make the system highly resilient to external attacks and is in line with the underlying philosophy of the Internet and Babel Society itself.


## App

The App is a smartphone application that will also provide a two-factor authentication, verify the person identity and provide access to all other technological tools available.

## Wallet

It's an application used to manage your personal resources and for buying products, well integrated in the App and with the E-commerce. Please have a look at [Consumption](#consumption) for more detailed information.

## E-commerce

Central place where all products available in the society will be stored. Each product will have detailed information in its production, if it is produced by the society itself, if we can buy it in the area nearby us and many more. We expect that most products will be available for delivery.

It will be seamlessly integrated with Wallet.

## Virtual Forum

The Virtual Forum is an online place where people can gather and discuss, share their interests and concerns, but more importantly apply changes to society itself through [projects](#projects). The identity of each person will be clearly displayed to ensure accountability.


# Society

We strongly believe that a competitive society is not sustainable in the long term, but rather causes many of the social problems we face today.

In a competitive society, the "other" becomes an enemy, someone to beat. Any mean is valid as long as we are ahead of everyone else, as long as we are the winners. This mentality does nothing but generate enemies and divisions, both on a macroscopic (e.g. wars between States) and microscopic (e.g. fights between colleagues) level. The reality is that every competition has only one winner, so if we accept unbridled competition on all fronts, we also accept the fact that everyone is a loser. By the law of large numbers, it is highly likely that both you, dear reader, and me will end up being losers in something. In the competitive sphere, defeats is unacceptable and always weigh in, it makes us feel less than others, unsuitable.

Humans are social animals. Our strength has always been in numbers, in the ability to join forces to create something extraordinary. Even the most introverted among us will never disdain the right company, indeed we often seek it.

The society we want, the society that best highlights the qualities of the human being, is a **collaborative society**. A society in which everyone has a role and can feel fulfilled. Where the neighbor is someone to collaborate with, to learn from, who will help us achieve our purpose and vice versa.  
Where our strengths are accentuated and others can make up for our shortcomings. Where there is room for the scientist as much as for the artist. A society that unites rather than divides.

In a collaborative society, classism stops making sense, as do racism, strict hierarchy, gender denigration, etc...

We welcome the fact that not all people are fully aligned with our [key concepts](#key-concepts) and the society proposed by Babel Society. We have no intention of convincing them nor converting them, we just want to live peacefully and be good neighbors.  
People who like other forms of societies like capitalism, republics, etc. are free to continue down that road; we value heterogeneity of thinking.

Babel Society aims to unite all people who today are already in line with our culture, to progress all together towards a better future.


## How to be part of it {#enter}

Any external person who wants to be part of our society will first have to get in touch with members who are already part of it. It will be up to them to present a [project](#projects) in their name in which members explain why the applicant should be part of our society. The applicant must be available to meet other interested members of the society in order to better assess whether it is appropriate to accept the application.  
If the project is accepted, the person will be admitted on a provisional basis. Once their eligibility has been demonstrated, the project can be considered concluded and they will become an actual member. Otherwise, the candidate is reject and the society will give them all the means needed to go somewhere else.

In the initial phase it is extremely important that all members are united and cohesive, that they strive towards the common goal.  
As the society acquires strength and autonomy, it will then be easier to accept new members thanks to the greater stability achieved.  
In any case, the necessary checks should always be made to maintain the right balance between heterogeneity of thinking and possible disruption of the status quo.


## How to get out

Leaving the society is quite easy: it will be enough to open a [project](#projects) in which the author communicates their will to leave. All privately owned assets, except real estates, can be brought with them, including all resources eligible at that time. It will be possible to request extra resources in order to be able to start a new life without being disadvantaged. In this last case, the debate will open to decide how many actual extra resources will be given.  
This is the only type of project that cannot be archived, if not by the author's own will.

Once accepted, the society will provide the necessary means to the outgoing party in order to help them reach the new desired location.

It will always be possible to rejoin the society, but you will have to go through the process described in [How to be a part of it](#enter).


## Decision making

In Babel Society all decisions are in the hand of its people and therefore there are no central government institutions.

Anyone can propose any change to society through [projects](#projects), which will be evaluated and discussed by other members of society. The only way to approve a project is through [consensus](#consensus).

In such a context, [education](#education) and learning how to properly engage in [fruitful discussions](#fruitful-discussions) is of the utmost importance. This is yet another reason to start small and grow organically.

This distribution of power ensures decisions will benefit all and render corruption unfeasible. Another benefit is that different geographical areas and ethnicities have different needs, and now we have all the tools we need to take care of it.

Babel Society encourages all members to always improve and refine any aspects of it, to inspect, test and analyze other solutions, to approach every matter through critical thinking.


## Participation

All members of the society can participate in every aspect of it, without limits of age, gender, sexual orientation, etc...

Participation will always be voluntary, so that one can freely choose which projects to participate in based on their interests.

It is assumed that each person will participate in those discussions that concern them the most or that they know better, thus optimizing decision time and information flow.


## Projects

Those who want to make changes to the system can do so by submitting a project in the [Virtual Forum](#virtual-forum).  
A project is a particular type of discussion in which it is clearly explained what are the reasons that led to the proposal and what actions must be taken to make it happen. A very important detail is that the project will have to identify the members of society on whom the proposed changes will have the greatest impact. The latter will have greater decision-making power on the proposal.

We will continue with a [fruitful discussion](#fruitful-discussions), critical and constructive, analyzing the project in every aspect, trying to improve it as possible, but also to understand if it is actually beneficial to carry it out.

The discussion must at least last a month, to give everyone the opportunity to participate.  
The method of approval will change according to the extent and impact area of the change: the greater the entity, the greater the amount of assent and critical thoughts it will have to gather.  
During the discussion, the skills necessary for the development of the project will have to be identified and possibly include which members will help in the implementation.

If accepted, the author of the project will be responsible for it and will have to carry it out, with the help of the whole society. The author may decide to yield ownership to somebody else, but this must be cleared upfront.


### Consensus

A project needs the full consent of all members interested in the proposal to be implemented. Reaching a consensus is essential to ensure the highest degree of efficiency during the implementation phase, but also to ensure that minorities aren't penalized.

Take for example a proposal in which you want to build a dam in order to divert a river to make an area more fertile. Suppose the river passes through a small town, but the flow is interrupted by the dam.

In this context the town people will have a substantial weight in the discussion, as the river could be their primary source of water. The proposal should also benefit them and include an alternative source of water in the project if needed.  
Another important weight will be given to civil engineers that can evaluate the feasibility of the dam, geologists to evaluate the environmental impact, but also farmers who will use the water to grow new products.  
In order to build the dam it is essential that all parties are in agreement and that a solution is found that does not harm anyone but rather enriches society as a whole.

Achieving consensus is in perfect harmony with a collaborative society, where the well-being of all is more important than individual interests.


### Phases

The project will have to go through several phases before it can be considered done:

- **Proposal**: in this phase the aim is to make the idea known, even a draft may be sufficient as it can be expanded later thanks to the comments received in the meantime. The proposal must attract a sufficient amount of interest in order to initiate a constructive discussion. The minimum limit should be 5 people (author excluded).

- **Review**: When the project is deemed ready and with sufficient details, it is exposed to a wider audience for thorough review. In this phase it will be necessary to specify which skills are recommended in order to discuss the topic in a critical and constructive way. The author will also have the burden of communicating the proposal to all major interested people identified so far.  
  This is the most important phase, where most of the discussions will take place and cannot last less than a month.  
  The purpose of the review is to find a solution that is congenial to all participants.

- **Voting**: a simple formal act to ensure consent has been reached on whether the project should be implemented or not. The vote must be communicated in time and must last at least 3 days, to give everyone the opportunity to participate. Those who have never commented in the discussion can vote too. The vote will be public to better understand what are the problems still to be discussed.  
  Based on the outcome, there will be three possible results:

  * Everyone votes for implementation: the project goes to "Implementation" phase
  * Everyone votes for archiving: the project goes to "Archived" phase
  * Some vote for implementation and others for archiving: the right compromise has not been reached yet and the project returns to "Review" phase.

  If you can't reach a compromise that suits everyone, there are still some underlying problems that have not been addressed, so it is good to continue discussing, perhaps addressing the subject from a different angle.

- **Archived**: if the project is rejected, it will go to the Archived phase.

- **Implementation**: once accepted, the project will go to the Implementation phase. Since the members of society agree with the proposal, it will be in the ideal condition to be effectively implemented. Now the work can start.

- **Concluded**: the project was successfully implemented.

- **Revoked**: Once concluded or during its implementation, new elements could be discovered that cause a substantial change of the initial plans. In this case the project must be revoked.


### Revocation of a project

A project could be revoked if, during its implementation or just after its conclusion, new elements are discovered that change the overall picture. Going back to the dam example, perhaps the alternative solution to cover the town's water needs is insufficient, or perhaps the environmental impact is more severe than expected. Whatever the reason, any concerned member of the society can file an injunction on the project and, after explaining their reasons in detail, further discussion will take place. This procedure is very similar to proposing a new change, but in case of serious problems it should be much faster. The simplest way is to contact the author of the project and the various members who have previously voted for it.

During the revocation, it is important to identify the short term solutions to fix any serious problem. Once the imminent dangers have been resolved, a new project will have to be created in order to address the problems caused in a thorough way, to find appropriate solutions in the long term, as well as to understand why those mistakes were made in the first place and to design, wherever possible, a way to decrease the chance of them happening again.


## Fruitful Discussions

Discussions are at the heart of Babel Society. Discussions can arise anywhere, but the best place to bring forward important topics is the [Virtual Forum](#virtual-forum), given that writing helps us fix thoughts and gives participants time to reflect on the content.  

At the base of every fruitful discussion there is the desire of collaboration. One must always keep in mind other members' points of view, which could be opposed to ours. In a fruitful discussion **there are no winners or losers**, what is important is to get to the bottom of the matter.  
The more people contribute to the discussion, the harder it will be to agree on a solution. In these cases it is essential to find a solution that everyone judges to be right and fair, one that all are willing to carry out. If this does not happen, diatribes on certain topics could arise, which will undermine the relationship between the members of society and could give life to conflicting groups. Finding an agreement is therefore essential for the functioning of a free and harmonious society.

Another important aspect is to discuss the merits of the question, relying as much as possible on ascertainable facts, without taking into account who initiated the discussion. Taking sides out of a sense of friendship (or enmity) is very dangerous and leads to bad decisions that could have serious repercussions on the whole society.

Learning how to discuss fruitfully will perhaps be one of the most difficult challenges for Babel Society, given that most societies today are geared towards discuss-to-win mentality. However, because we will start as a small group that should be already well versed in fruitful discussions, it will be easier to ensure every new member learns this skill and we are confident it will soon become natural. For those wishing to get ahead, we recommend reading [Crucial Conversations](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15014.Crucial_Conversations).


## Education

Any society will be always as good as its average member, it is therefore fundamental to have a good general education level. Ignorance makes it easy to manipulate the masses and could lead to shortsighted choices that over time could destroy the very fabric of society, as we can now see with the impending ecological catastrophe. 

Education is essential for a society to function properly, but the school system as we all know isn't a suitable solution. Many people have been traumatized by school, some still have real nightmares about exams and homework. In many cases school raises people who hate studying instead of helping them enjoy it.

The main reason for being unsuitable as a method of instruction is that the school is structured in such a way as to trap the student in well-defined activities in which they don't have much choice. This is in stark contrast with the outside world, where little is established and we have to find our own path.

The educational system proposed by Babel Society is free and takes into account everyone's peculiarities, different attitudes and learning speed. We want to create a system without "classes", age division and grades.  
Children will start by exploring different topics to understand what they have more aptitude towards and learn basic skills, but the most important part will be to give them the necessary tools to evolve within society itself, such as critical thinking, the importance of [authenticity](#authenticity), of [collaboration](#collaboration), to respect others and what you have. In short, teaching them how to make the most out of the world we live in.  
It is fundamental to make learning something positive, the best time of their days.  
Learning should never create a scar but rather foster personal growth.

Subsequent studies will not be decided by fixed degrees, but students will have various courses at their disposal that they can explore **throughout their life**.  
Small pieces that we can use to build our personal mosaic of knowledge.

These courses will be more similar to the college "subjects". Each course may require the overcoming of others before it and this is how we will gradually advance in knowledge.

Lessons should be interactive, spark discussions and take the time to deepen what the students have learned. We believe that different subjects need different methods to be learned. For example, chemistry and physics will be more interesting if theory is accompanied by experiments to put it into practice. Math can be better interiorized if we give students problems and help them reach the solution. History will have more effect if instead of dwelling only on the general aspect of it, we will take the time to narrate the lives of the key characters of the time, of how people lived, of the substantial differences with the reality we now take for granted. Geography will be better appreciated if students are given the opportunity to visit the studied places. These are just a few ideas, it will be up to teachers and researchers to better understand how to maximize learning.

The free choice of courses will allow everyone to learn at their own pace. Too often the emphasis in schools is on getting a good grade rather than making sure the student has actually learned a concept.  
Since there will be no homework nor exams, it is up to teachers to decide whether a student has completed the course.

It is good to point out that the courses will have no age limit, so we could have adults, seniors and teenagers in a single room. Although bizarre by today's standards, this generational mix could instead stimulate interesting discussions, as well as bring the various age groups closer together.

An online lesson archive will be created so that everyone can benefit from the best teachers available to society. Attending lessons in person is the recommended way and the society itself will provide the necessary means for each person to do so. However, remote learning will also be made available to make up for cases in which attending in person is not possible, or is the method preferred by the student.

Proper education is made possible only by competent and passionate teachers who are able to convey their love for the subject.  
We firmly believe that teachers are the pillars of our future society, for this reason becoming a teacher will not be easy, it will not be enough to know the subject, specific courses for teaching must be completed. The psychological aspect is very important and should not be neglected, especially when dealing with children and adolescents.

In order to ensure that teachers can adequately follow their students, this system assumes a limited number of participants, probably no more than 10 per course. Training a sufficient number of capable and prepared teachers will be the greatest challenge for this system. In the event of a shortage of teachers, priority should be given to children, while others can make up for it through self learning based on the material available.


## Merits

Anyone who achieves an illustrious result within the society can be awarded with Merits. Merits can be accumulated and last throughout the person's life, however they are not transferable. You may think of Merits as a Nobel Prize.  
It is good to specify immediately that having zero Merits is normal and there will be no substantial difference between those who have obtained Merits and those who haven't.  
The only material benefit given by the Merits is higher priority in [waiting lists](#waiting-lists).

It is good to specify that although many Merits designate an illustrious person whose ideas should always be listened to and pondered upon, this does not mean that they are right regardless. Society should always use critical thinking when it comes to making decisions.

Obtaining merits will not be easy, as they can only be given after achieving a feat that a large part of society considers important and significant. In order to bestow merits, we need to open a [project](#projects) which outlines the feat achieved and why it is significant; the author cannot be the recipient of the Merits. In order to be accepted, these projects must reach and be voted on by a good portion of the population. The higher it is, the more Merits will be bestowed. What follows is a hypothetical outline:

- at least 25% of the population, 1 Merit
- at least 40% of the population, 2 Merits
- at least 60% of the population, 5 Merits
- at least 80% of the population, 8 Merits
- at least 90% of the population, 10 Merits

It goes from itself that researchers will be the category with the greatest chance of obtaining Merits, as their job is precisely to find ways to greatly improve certain aspects of our society.

In the case of necessary jobs that nobody wants to do, the society could also decide to assign Merits based on the amount of hours worked, perhaps in quantities influenced by [job level](#job-levels). They have put themselves at the service of the community and therefore it is right that society recognizes their value.


## Crimes

Project Terra wants to organize a society in which it is hard to commit crimes.  
For example, by disconnecting the [consumption of goods](#consumption) from the [work done](#work), all those crimes mainly caused by hunger and discontent are eliminated. There will be no reason for a person to rely on criminal organizations just because they have to support their family. Criminal activities such as drugs dealing and smuggling would be much more complex to manage because [there will be no money to fuel them](#economics).  
Thefts are expected to decrease significantly as everyone has access to the same items.  
By creating a society where we can all be [authentic](#authenticity), hate crimes should drastically decrease too. This effect should be amplified by [collaboration](#collaboration), as it will create a sense of conviviality that will make us less inclined to selfishness.  
Finally, the [focus on education](#education) should provide younger generations the tools to enjoy life rather than destroy it.

Nonetheless, we are aware that there will always be crimes. Humans can be extremely creative when it comes to bypassing the system and causing troubles.

Society will therefore still need a form of police, i.e. trained personnel able to make all members of society feel safe, to intervene in the event of crimes such as murders, violence, thefts and so on. In order to avoid an escalation of violence, normal police officers will only have tools to subdue individuals.  
The ultimate goal of this role is to find the culprit and ensure that they are taken into custody. Once done, it will be the turn of a team of psychologists specialized in crimes who, using the evidence collected by the police, will have to understand if they have arrested the right person.  
Dialog with the alleged criminal is fundamental. Based on these discussions, the team may request verification of certain facts, gathering of additional evidence, or perhaps seeking support from other colleagues.  
Once they are sure they have the right person, they will have to assess the seriousness of the crime and assign the most appropriate sentence. If in doubt, they will be able to discuss the situation in a larger group, perhaps seeking the support of a legal expert, or even bring the case to the attention of society as a whole.

The police structure will be much different from today. There will be no hierarchy of power and it will be similar to any other job. There will be less focus on following a predetermined set of rules, on mindless discipline and more on helping people feel safe.


## Rehabilitation System

Project Terra does not believe in punishments bordering on torture or death penalty. Collaborating also means not leaving behind those who find it difficult to adapt, respecting them as humans and living beings.  
Treating the disturbing people as if they were monsters only increases their hatred towards society.  
After the rehabilitation process, we want these people to be able to be just members of society, correct what led them to commit the crime, give them the opportunity to contribute to the well-being of all and to fulfill themselves. After all, no one is perfect and we can all make a mistake.

Understanding why they did what they did can also be a moment of introspection for the society as a whole, to understand if we failed in some aspect of it.

This system is largely inspired by the [Halden Prison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halden_Prison). 


### Rehabilitation programs

Every time a crime is committed it will be followed by a rehabilitation program.  
The program involves discussion with a psychologist specialized in rehabilitation who aims to understand what were the causes that led the person to commit the crime. Once identified, a training course for rehabilitation purposes will be agreed with the person. The psychologist will follow the person throughout the process, to ensure maximum effectiveness and agree on any changes to the program based on the person's progress.  
Rehabilitation will include a mix of specific courses, more [generic courses](#education) and possibly also jobs to participate in.

For example, suppose we have a tendency to waste food, to the point where we no longer have resources available to feed us. In this case the system will immediately assign you to a rehabilitation program. Let's suppose that thanks to the psychologist we understand that we waste resources due to a lack of discipline, poor diet and not knowing how to cook. In this case we will be directed to a course for effective resource management, a course for proper nutrition and one to learn how to cook.


### Minor offenses

Minor offenses (also known as petty crimes) are usually regulated in a precise manner by the legislative system and have a recommended rehabilitation program. Some examples could be littering the environment, damaging common goods, excessive and systematic waste of resources, theft of small objects and not participating in any production activity for an excessive period of time.

If you persevere in committing minor offenses, the case will get much more serious until it becomes a [major offense](#major-offenses).


### Major offenses

Major offenses are always punished with [imprisonment](#imprisonment). If the malefactor also has [Merits](#merits), it could be decided to eliminate a part of them and even reset them in the most extreme cases.

Some examples of major offenses are murder, theft of a massive amount of assets, omission by a manufacturer, pollution, neglecting maintenance of important structures (e.g. bridges), as well as causing a violent group reaction, especially hate crimes.


### Imprisonment

The greatest punishment that can be cast is the restriction of freedom.  
During this period, the inmate will be guaranteed living conditions similar to those they would have outside. We reiterate that the punishment is freedom deprivation, not torture.

On the basis of the crime committed and the motivation identified by the team of psychologists, a rehabilitation program will be established, at the end of which the inmate will be able to become an active member of society. If the inmate is not deemed harmful for other members of society, it would be good to organize mixed courses in which people from outside the imprisonment facility are also present. In this way the inmates maintain a semblance of normality and this will facilitate their reintegration.

During the rehabilitation period, inmates will be engaged in the care of prisons, carrying out tasks such as cooking, laundry, cleaning, etc... Whenever possible, some could be directed towards relevant jobs to make them productive and stimulate them to a healthier lifestyle. Leisure activities will be limited to what is possible within the structures.

Although lacking in freedom, they always remain members of society and therefore will have full access to the Virtual Forum and discussions.  
Access to the Virtual Forum can be useful for reporting cases of mistreatment, violence and other behaviors that are not in line with the values of our society.  
Inmates will have access to external phone calls and visits, as well as to the Internet, albeit monitored and limited.

All the [resources used](#economics) within the facility will be consumed by the inmates' accounts. This will allow prisoners to collaborate in deciding how to best use the available resources; the dialog must be mediated by specialized personnel if necessary.

Once you have successfully passed the established program, you return to freedom without any other penalties whatsoever.  
In the case of violent crimes, such as murder and especially if premeditated, the team of psychologists who followed the inmate during the rehabilitation will determine the conclusion of the program.


### Appeal

If an inmate is firmly convinced that they have been unjustly incarcerated, they can appeal by presenting a [project](#projects) explaining their side to the story. This option is only valid for long sentences.  
Such projects must be taken very seriously and the society should be responsive to appeals.

Even the most competent of us can make mistakes in judgment, so it is possible to convict an innocent.

If the project passes the proposal phase, the group of specialists who found it guilty will have to be notified and will be required to present all facts that let them make this decision. During the review phase, the inmate will be able to meet all interested people, so that they can form a better picture.  
If there is a consensus that a mistake has been made, the inmate will be released immediately.


### Extreme cases

The history of humanity has unfortunately generated people who could be defined as "without hope". Cases devoid of any form of empathy, time bombs that once fired up are difficult to put back together.  
In these extreme cases where the rehabilitation program has no effect, in order to ensure the safety of all members of society, it will be necessary to resort to life imprisonment.

Specialized institutions may be needed to manage these troublesome members of our society, to keep them under close surveillance and in greater isolation should they be a danger to other inmates.  
We must emphasize that in this case too we must guarantee them a fair quality of life.

The greatest achievement as a society would be to find a role for them, give them a goal, make them useful and fulfilled.


## Legal system

The society will have at its disposal a totally digital system of laws which is always accessible by everyone.  
It is very important that laws are clear, written in such a way that every member of society can understand them. We imagine the set of laws as the society manual, a text we can always refer to discover every side and possibility made available by our system.

Like every other aspect of our society, the set of laws can be modified in every part through [projects](#projects).

It is important to understand how a law has evolved over time, which is why it must be managed through a [Version Control System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control), in order to have a clear view of what changed, when, by whom and as a result of which project.


## Euthanasia

The ultimate goal of Babel Society is to create a world in which all life can flourish in harmony. **To fully accept life we need to accept death.**
Today's society is raging on life and youth, making death something unnatural, something to escape from, always and in any case.

We should clarify that by "death" we mean "natural death", such as old age or incurable diseases. Taking the life of any living being for no real reason is the most ignoble and evil act a person could do.

That said, death is perhaps the greatest gift nature has bestowed upon us. Without death there would be no new life, we would not progress in our evolution as a species, there would be no renewal. A world without death is a world of stagnation: still, immobile, meaningless.  
Refusing death does nothing but undermine our potential future, it makes us believe we have infinite time in this world, but instead it's the most precious resource we have. Life is too short to waste it on artificial worries and anxieties, to make useless and counterproductive wars...

For this reason we gladly accept death in its most merciful form: euthanasia.

Any member of society in full possession of his mental faculties can request euthanasia. The request will be evaluated by a team of specialized psychologists who will understand why the applicant chose such an extreme remedy. Psychologists will do their best to support the applicant in order to find a path that makes them enjoy life again. The applicant should at least attempt the recovery. Sometimes it can happen that a tragic event mentally breaks us to such an extent we desire death, however it is often possible to get up with the right support, to put the pieces back together.  
Other cases may have to do with patients afflicted with incurable diseases, whose only prospect is suffering and decay.  
After careful analysis and discussion, the date for euthanasia will be set. It remains possible for the applicant to cancel at any time if they change their mind.

In cases where the person is mentally defective and not self-sufficient, it will be up to the legal guardians to decide whether it is appropriate to resort to euthanasia. Even these cases will be evaluated by a specialized team in order to ascertain that this is the most humane solution.


# Economics

The definition we prefer is the one from French economist and politician Raymond Barre:

> _Economics is the science of managing scarce resources_. It examines the forms taken by human behavior in the management of these resources; analyzes and explains the ways in which an individual or a society allocates _limited means to the satisfaction of multiple and unlimited needs_.

History has shown that money isn't a suitable tool for resource management, as it disconnects resource availability from consumption and gives us a false sense of infinite growth; this is no longer sustainable globally.

Thanks to technology it is now possible to trace all the resources produced and consumed by society.  We want to create a decentralized computer system, free, accessible and usable by all.

Once the produced resources are known, the system will fairly distribute them to all members of society, with no regards to their profession. It will be up to each person to decide how and when to spend the given resources.

However, the assigned resources will be available for a limited time. The accounts will be periodically rebalanced: the remaining resources will be added to those produced and redistributed fairly.


## Fair distribution

It is good to dwell on the concept of fair distribution. Keep in mind that the planet's resources, although abundant, are limited in quantity. On the other hand, human desires tend to be infinite, which is why consumerism has led to such massive and catastrophic imbalance and waste of resources.  
The system proposed aligns infinite desires with the actual supply. 

We then consider that each person has different needs and desires. For example, some people are gluten intolerant, so there is no point in giving them gluten products. Others may live in particularly hilly areas, so using a bicycle is not congenial.

A fair distribution does not mean that everyone will have the exact same amount of each resource, but rather all they need to live the best possible life they want with respect to available resources.

We will start with an equal share, but quotas can change through [projects](#projects), due to medical assessment or due to balancing of the system.  
To ensure a fair share to everybody, it is important to track both production and actual consumption of each individual. By entering these data into a computer system, analyzing them according to the most modern statistical and artificial intelligence processes, it will be possible over time to create increasingly precise models that will help the society decide which production of goods to enhance and how to best distribute the available resources.

This system is in line with the concept of a collaborative society, as everyone collaborates in order to have the best possible life together.

However, we are aware that the human soul can be as altruistic as it is selfish, therefore any systematic and excessive waste will be monitored and corrected through the [rehabilitation system](#rehabilitation-system).


## Privacy
For this system to function correctly, the data on production, availability and consumption of resources of individual members must be readable by everyone. Imagining today that all these data are at everyone's mercy may be frightening, but in a collaborative society this problem does not stand.

In the market society a person's quality of life strictly depends on their ability to sell a certain product on the market (goods, services and work). Hence, marketing: the activity of understanding and influencing the masses in order to sell a product. The more personal data they have about a person, the more accurate the profile will be and easier it will be to influence them.  
In a nutshell, **the privacy issue is largely due to the society we are in**.

Thanks to a fair resource distribution that is disconnected from what the person is capable of producing, **we have effectively eliminated the need to manipulate the masses**. In other words, we have made the members of society _people_ rather than _consumers_.  
In this new society, there is no reason to misuse this information.

Another problem linked to privacy could be the advent of an authoritarian regime that tends to violently persecute certain groups. Babel Society organizes society in such a way as to significantly limit that this could happen, however the risk can never be completely canceled. It's worth mentioning that today such a risk is much more accentuated, as we can see from the raise of political consensus by nazism and fascism sympathizers around the world.


## Sustainability

Remember that "collaboration" is not limited to the human sphere, but extends to nature itself. Being in tune with natural cycles is essential for our survival, as evidenced by the increasingly frequent natural disasters caused by the imbalance introduced by humans.

History teaches us that a management of scarce resources that doesn't consider a sustainable cycle of production and consumption is a short-sighted and self-destructive one.

This is why creating a [Circular Economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_economy) is extremely important. All goods and services produced within Babel Society must be designed taking into consideration their entire life cycle, with particular attention to: the ecological sustainability of the entire production line; the possibility of repairing it and recovering materials once it falls into disuse.

It is good to specify that it is not enough to create quality and lasting goods, the recovery of materials is crucial. Think about how much garbage and hazardous waste is produced by technological advancement, by new iterations of high-tech products, such as a new smartphone, television, etc... 

The distribution of new products must be balanced by its sustainability. Rather than mass-producing every single innovation, it would be more appropriate to focus on research and limit mass distribution to significant improvements. We believe that there is very little value in switching to a more powerful smartphone if you then keep using it in the same way as the previous one. On the other hand, the generational leap from mobile phones to smartphones has been significant and has brought a concrete improvement to everyone's life.

An added benefit of focusing more on research and innovation rather than mass-production is that we will have better products in less time, with less resources.


## Consumption

All resources made available to the individual will be distributed in personal accounts. You can imagine these accounts as a bank account. These resources will be for the exclusive use of the individual and they can freely decide how and when to use them. Although there is a periodic balancing of the accounts, it will never create a case in which resources disappear from the account. This is important to ensure a better plan of your expenses.

Resources will not be transferable between accounts; this measure is needed to help prevent crimes such as illegal drugs traffic.

Through the [Wallet](#wallet) it will be possible to view the resources available in your account at any time. The application will help in the managing resources and warn us in case we are consuming too many resources.

Instead of having a single entry such as "money", the Wallet will show everything that is currently produced and accessible by each member, for example: wheat, milk, electricity, etc...  
Another important application is the [E-commerce](#e-commerce) where we can purchase products online. Each product will consume a certain amount of resources, taking into account both the necessary raw materials, but also the production and transportation process. For example, to produce bread we will consume wheat, flour, drinking water, but also wood for the oven. The asset must be packaged and then transported, so these resources will also be considered in the final cost of the product. **Pollution is a very important detail that must be included in the system as a resource**. This will help educate people to choose goods in a more sustainable way.  
Keeping an eye on all these details for the purchase of every single product is unsustainable for us humans, so the application will show how much we can buy of a particular product. Returning to the example of bread, in the E-commerce we'll see that based on the resources in our account, we can still buy 100 pieces.  
Note the change of perspective. Instead of knowing how much "it costs", we will immediately know how much "we can afford", so in this case a higher number is better. This will make it much easier to decide whether to buy a product.

Buying goods in regular stores will work the same way. Just bring your device close to the stand with the product to have access to the detailed sheet, purchasable quantity and the possibility of adding it to the virtual cart. Once the shopping has been completed, simply confirm the purchase of the goods on the Wallet. This system should be familiar to all those who have used at least once the "fast shopping" systems already available in various supermarkets.  
The purchase option will only be present if the device recognizes that we are within a particular store. This detail is essential to understand the effectiveness of the various distribution centers.

In restaurants and bars, the entire menu will be available via the QR Code present at the table, so you can order and pay directly from the Wallet.

Whenever possible, the products should be purchased directly from the producer. The producer will initiate a transaction through the E-commerce, which the buyer will then confirm from their device. Babel Society wants to structure the various residential centers so that it is possible to buy perishable goods directly from producers as much as possible.


### Expensive Goods

An expensive good may require a quantity of resources that we would not normally have access to. Let's imagine that 1.2 kg of lithium is needed to make an electric car, but normally the production of lithium is such that each member receives only 100 grams every month.  
Considering that accounts are periodically rebalanced, we will never have enough resources to buy the car.

The solution is to budget. In our App we will be able to budget the car and decide how many resources we want to allocate at the end of each month as a payment. Suppose that we don't need lithium for anything else, we could decide to save 100% of it. Once blocked, these resources will be considered as "consumed", so they can no longer be used in any other way or redistributed. In around a year we will reach the quota of 1.2 kg of lithium, and we will finally be able to obtain the good so much desired.

Budgeting helps also with production planning, given that we already know how many people are interested in a product and can forecast when they will pay it out.

In order to avoid excessive blocking of resources, there will be the limit that a resource can be blocked by only one budget. This means that if I want to budget another product that needs lithium, I would not be able to do so as this resource is already in use by the car.

This system may seem similar to buying a product in installments, but the substantial difference is that all the resources necessary for its realization will be available. When we buy something in installments, we get the product immediately, with the promise of paying what is owed in the future. It is a game of odds, as it is not certain that in the future we will have enough resources to pay for it. This constraint can also create stress, as one is obliged to pay; another negative effect of installments is that we have the impression of being able to live above our own means, causing more and more debt and very easily ruining our life.  
The reason why resources are blocked on the last day of the month is precisely to ensure their availability. Skipping a month or adding less than expected to the budget will not be a problem, the only negative effect is to lengthen the time a bit.


### Foreign products

By foreign products we mean all goods and services that are made by companies outside our society.  
These products must be requested through a [project](#projects) which specifies who the manufacturer is and why we want to obtain it. At this stage, all those interested in the product can make their voices heard. If there is a lot of demand, a member can be designated to contact the manufacturer directly and buy in large quantities at factory price.  
We will also have to estimate the resources needed for the production of it and the expected pollution. As the product is created by a third party, the estimation doesn't have to be precise, but it remains important to understand what kind of impact our purchases have on the environment.

The e-commerce system must provide the possibility of making individual purchases on external systems, however these purchases must be confirmed and motivated by the aforementioned project. A project can only be linked to one purchase. In the event that the asset is for personal use, the resources will be deducted from the accounts of the interested people.

The project must also indicate whether you intend to purchase the product one or more times. For periodic purchases, the product must be added to the e-commerce system to be on a par with any other asset. It is always good to highlight on the platform which are foreign products and which are produced in the society, moreover it should be avoided that an external product competes with an internal one. If the native product is not considered up to par with a similar foreign product, the whole society should make an effort to bridge the quality gap.


## Production

We will always need to consume some other resource for producing a certain product. All resources belong to the society, therefore it will be necessary to propose a project to gather the necessary material.  
These proposals will have to describe in detail the production process, how the society will benefit from it and possibly include any research associated with it. Important details to highlight will be the quantity of resources required, both periodically and one-off, the expected degree of pollution, the quantity of product generated, the durability of the product itself, expected life, how many resources would be possible to recycle and expected consumer base.  
In case of a new product or production process, we should always start with a minimum quantity as theory and practice often diverge.

The "Proposal" phase of the [project](#projects) is particularly important since it will be the time to make the product known and understand if it has traction in the society or not, as well as to better know future users. For example, if all stakeholders are in the same geographic area, it will be better to produce as close as possible to simplify transport. If only a handful of users are particularly interested, perhaps a manual production system will suffice, thus lowering the initial resources investment and make the project more attractive.

The project will be considered concluded once the preparations necessary to start production have been completed and after at least one batch of products have been successfully delivered.

It is important to consider that the required resources will be deducted from the total available before being distributed to all members. Resources are precious and limited. This process serves to ensure that only products worthy of being made will have an impact on resources.

Each production process also needs workers. There will be a section of the Virtual Forum where you can post job advertisements for your project.

In the event that less than expected is produced, the concession of resources could be blocked and an investigation will be opened in order to understand where the problem lies and if, in the face of the new production level, it still makes sense to continue this business. This limitation does not apply to activities which by nature may have fluctuating production, such as agriculture.


## Work

Work will be a very different concept when compared to the market societies.

All members of the society will always receive the same amount of resources, regardless of the type of work performed. The only requirement is to be committed to something fruitful.

Babel Society recognizes that the ultimate goal of humans is not work itself, but to create, explore, grow and enjoy the life that has been given to us.

Therefore, each person will be free to choose the profession that best suits their peculiarities and attitudes. **There will be no better or more profitable job than the other**.

Producers will often need help in order to run their business and it will be up to each member of society to contribute. However, the relationship between "employer" and "worker" will disappear. There will be no binding contract, no working schedule nor set amount of hours that must be respected. That said, it is good to agree on the amount of hours available on average to better organize.

Helping in production is extremely important, the more we produce, the more society will benefit from the greater abundance. However, Babel Society does not want to create a society that produces for the sole purpose of producing. **Our aim is to produce the right amount of products in order to guarantee everyone a comfortable and meaningful life**.

Each person can also carry out more activities, the important thing is that they do it out of desire and not out of necessity.


## Job levels

Many jobs need certain skills in order to be carried out at their best. Let's think for example of the surgeon, who needs a deep knowledge of the human body, a steady hand, but will also be subject to much higher responsibilities than the norm.  
In order to access these jobs we will need to train staff. The [educational system](#education) already provides courses open to all, which will then be integrated with experience on the field.

Most jobs will be divided into levels. Each level will require greater skills, autonomy and responsibility.  
To access the first level it will be enough to follow the aforementioned courses, but to reach a higher position we will have to find a tutor at a higher level, possibly more than one.  
The tutor will supervise the work we do and give us advice on what we need to work on to move forward.  
When they judge us ready, they can propose our promotion. This will be followed by a trial period for the next level, always under our tutor supervision, who will be partly responsible for what we do. How we perform in this new role should be documented and will be used in the next phase.  
Once the trial period is over, our tutor will file a [project](#projects) for our promotion. A group of already qualified people will review our work and decide if it is appropriate to promote us or not. Those who vote against promotion will have to give adequate reasons and can become the new tutor in turn.

There will be no limit on the amount of people at each level, but we encourage making the distinction between levels meaningful. 

As an example, let's examine the profession of the surgeon once more. To access the first level we will need advanced knowledge of the human body, perhaps specialized in a specific area. We will also need theoretical knowledge of the various techniques to operate, of instruments, etc...  
The first level will consist in assisting surgeons in the operating room and carrying out simple tasks, such as preparing the patient or passing the right instrument. At this level we will practically be spectators. We will also have to practice mock surgery to get confidence with the process and tools.  
The next level could involve simple and routine surgeries, but in this case they would be carried out with the assistance of an already competent surgeon, usually a tutor. Once you have acquired sufficient experience, we will start working alone, and then gradually move on to increasingly complex surgeries as we reach subsequent levels.

If we realize that we are not suitable for the profession undertaken, we can always change and try something else.  
This tiered structure will ensure that everyone can understand which profession is best suited to their abilities, as well as to grow and bring out the maximum potential in each one.

Both the courses achieved and the level in a given profession will be used in the Virtual Forum in order to advise on what projects to review.

It is important to understand that job levels aren't a form of hierarchy of power, but rather a hierarchy of trust. People at a higher level are deemed by society to be more trustworthy and have demonstrated their skills on that particular role, that's why they are honored by entrusting greater responsibilities upon them. However, they will have little to no power over people at lower job levels. They can lead others and define complex solution to complex problems, but they can't impose their will over others. Babel Society desires that all workers, whatever the level, must always use their critical thinking and never blindly follow orders. Inspecting other people solutions will help better understand them, perhaps even improve some solutions and for sure make us more skilled. Babel Society encourages inquiries and deep understanding, "it is how it is" should never be considered as an acceptable answer.


## Means of the trade

Certain jobs require special tools. In this case the society will provide them when appropriate. These instruments are to be considered on loan, they must be maintained with extreme care and respect. If you stop doing that job, all tools must be given back so that others can use them.


## Art

Art is at the center of the expression of our human soul. Babel Society highly values all forms of art, such as sculptors, painters, dancers, acrobats, musicians, etc...

Artists will be free to do what they do best: whisper to our hearts, inspire and make us dream.

Being an artist will have the same structure as any other jobs, including levels. Once the society will be big enough, we would advise to establish the so-called [Journeyman years](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journeyman_years) to foster creativity.


## Humble and tiring jobs

If we can all do the job we like best, who will do the humblest and most tiring jobs?
The short-term answer is "everyone". Many of the jobs that today we find tiring can often be eliminated.

For example, everyone should learn how to clean their home, as well as the many common facilities. In public toilets there should be a sanitization system available to be applied before use, so that we leave it cleaner that we found it.  
Thanks to this collective effort, we will no longer need janitors, or at least that type of work will become much easier.

Restaurants could also be structured in a way that let customers bring food to the table once it is ready.

Other jobs, such as harvesting the fields, should be done with the help of the whole society. These activities often help us remain humble and give a sense of conviviality; they could become moments of celebration where we can share the fruits of the earth. Hard work done all together is much easier and lighter.

All of these changes are easily applied in a small, likely-minded society that grows in a sustainable way.

Other jobs should be encouraged through social responsibility, perhaps rotating from time to time and conferring [Merits](#merits) based on the number of hours performed.

However, the long-term solution is automation. Babel Society will focus heavily on research in order to eliminate those chores that nobody wants to do, especially those that are repetitive or are considered dangerous and high-risk.


## Research

In a society where working is not necessary to survive, technological advancement becomes even more important as it will contribute to the improvement of everyone's life.

Both physical and virtual research centers will be developed in which all people can exchange information freely. Research is the field that more than any other will benefit from high collaboration. Very often particular inventions and discoveries are kept under strict control through patents and so on, which limit their application as well as their advancement. Thanks to the collaborative environment, everyone will be able to take advantage of the best discoveries much quicker.

Research often requires huge funds before leading to any result, but this will no longer be a problem: just present a [project](#projects) explaining the final goal of it and the amount of resources needed. In this case the project will remain in the "Implementation" phase until the research is completed.

We should facilitate any attempt at research, but it is always important to keep an eye on the amount of resources required. A very important aspect is how ethical the research is: cruel experiments on living beings should be avoided as much as possible.

It goes without saying that much of the research will never bear any fruits, but this is an intrinsic risk in the activity carried out and one we gladly accept. Failure is not a problem and can happen to even the most brilliant researcher, however it is better to realize it and communicate it to save important resources.


## Retirement

It will be possible for all members to retire once they are 60 years old, i.e. they will be exempt from having to participate in any productive activity.

In special cases, such as due to medical conditions, you may be able to retire early. In this case, we must file a [project](#projects) in order to document what happened and allow everyone to carry out the necessary checks.

The exemption is to be considered optional, we would be able to join back the workforce whenever we want.


## Waiting Lists

We may find ourselves in a situation where the demand for a particular good or service is higher than the society can produce. Part of the problem is solved through the [budgeting system](#expensive-goods), but the problem remains for requesting substantial resources for research or starting a business.  
To overcome this problem, priority waiting lists will be established based on [Merits](#merits) and possibly other factors. For example, in the event of a pandemic, priority will be given to treating the most affected groups.

By priority waiting lists we mean a system in which the first one to enqueue will be served, then the second and so on, until the list is exhausted; however, people with higher priority will be placed closer to the top of the list than they normally would. This system must be calibrated in such a way that all those enqueued will have their turn within a reasonable delay.

The system must ensure that everyone has the opportunity to access the required services, thus each waiting list will have a limit of how much a turn can be delayed.

## Foreign Organizations

Foreign organizations can only do business with society as a whole. All terms of any contracts must be presented by the company through [projects](#projects) using an ad-hoc account. As usual, any proceeds from such agreements will be considered as part of our resources and [fairly distributed to all members](#fair-distribution).  
Foreign organizations should never have in concession fundamental services, such as water, to ensure the autonomy and survival of our society.

Any foreign company that wants to operate on our territory will be required to respect all the rules of the society, including maximum transparency. They must give access and provide the necessary documentation on what happens in our territory.  
Pollution will not be tolerated. There should always be a clause in the contract that cancels it in case of pollution and burdens the organization to remedy the damage done.

If the organization needs personnel to carry out their functions in our territory, they will be required to hire at least 70% of personnel from our society. This should ensure the legitimacy of the business and that it is in line with our principles.

The assets necessary for the conduct of the business, such as buildings and machinery, will be provided by our society, but collaboration with the organization staff is not excluded if special construction techniques are required or to speed up the process. The project must also specify how many resources these assets will consume and a fee could be requested to the organization itself. Whatever the external contribution, all assets will remain property of the society.


## Tourism

Tourism will be an excellent source of foreign currency, but also a vector of change, a way to show the world the quality of our society. All tourists will be welcome, from any country and region of the world.

Considering that all consumption is based on an online system, tourists will be required to register at the entrance and purchase standard resource packs that can be used throughout the trip.

Like everybody else, they will be required to respect the environment: littering and other acts of incivility will be subject to very high sanctions. 


## Production growth

The quantity of goods produced will determine the quality of life of each member of our society. We are confident that the focus on [collaboration](#collaboration), [education](#education) and [research](#research) will be able to trigger a virtuous cycle capable of achieving unprecedented levels of production and profit. Let's think, for example, of all the benefits that a highly automated system could guarantee.

We remain aware that theory and reality often diverge, for example having to reach a consensus in each [project](#projects) objectively takes more time when compared to a structure in which decisions are centralized; in this regard, monarchy is faster and it is no coincidence that companies resemble a feudal model.  
Nonetheless, **values such as greater collaboration and freedom are more important to us than faster production growth**.  
We also accept the fact that no member of society will ever reach a level of opulence comparable to the top 1% in market society; but this is by design.

It is good to remember that the purpose of Babel Society isn't to create a highly productive system, but rather a society in which everyone has all they need to achieve their own happiness.  
Happiness is a state of the mind, often stimulated by succeeding in our intentions, by finishing something we are proud of or satisfied with, in perfect line with our crafty nature. Once the basic needs are guaranteed, happiness has very little to do with how many and what kind of goods we have.


# Personal sphere


## Competition

Although our society places great emphasis on collective collaboration, on a personal level some healthy competition never hurts and certainly shouldn't be stigmatized. Both competition and collaboration are part of our human nature, therefore it is good to have ways to exercise this characteristic in a healthy way.  
One way will be through sports and martial arts, but also other kinds of competitions, such as musical ones, videogames tournaments, etc...

We hope that a healthy and positive competition will always be established, in which our rivals are respected and seen as companions on a journey, perhaps as a goal to reach and overcome. Why not, they might become our best friends.


## Private property

It is widely demonstrated that humans need stability in order to function at their best and live a peaceful life. Private ownership, i.e. being able to benefit from a particular asset in an exclusive and unlimited way, helps us increase this sense of stability and our planning skills.

Any assets we buy through the resources granted by the society will be considered to all intents and purposes private property.


## Recreational Activities

Recreational activities are just as important as productive ones for a healthy and balanced life. Each person should have enough time to spend with their family, especially with their children. This is why we always recommend balancing your days between productive and recreational activities.  
We emphasize that productivity, although very important for the proper functioning of society, must never be at the expense of one's personal life.

Several studies have shown that to be fully productive and enjoy greater creativity, rest and idleness are essential. A good book that links productivity to rest is "[The Power of Full Engagement](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/68985.The_Power_of_Full_Engagement)" by James E. Loher and Tony Schwartz.  
In fact, the moment in which our brain is able to work best is when we are in complete idleness, in which there is no other distraction but ourselves and it becomes easier to analyze our life, our problems, especially those within.

Idleness, while useful, is certainly not one of the most social recreational activities; we hope that society will organize itself in such a way to provide ample opportunities for recreation.


## Sexual identity

In full respect of everyone's [freedom](#freedom) and [authenticity](#authenticity), we respect and promote exploring and understanding oneself and one's sexual identity.  
The different sexual identities will all enjoy the same rights, including being able to have a family and children.

A very important aspect will also be sexual education, which we believe should be carried out already in early adolescence to help them better understand all the changes in their body and manage the cravings related to the sexual sphere in a healthy way.


## Spirituality and Religion

Spirituality and freedom of religion is very important for self-realization and therefore all beliefs are admitted. We consider spirituality as strictly personal. Religious organizations will not have any particular treatment and all its members will have to fully respect the decisions of the society, as well as be an active member of it.

Peaceful coexistence and collaboration between members of different beliefs is fundamental. We remind ourselves that to build any type of structure we need the consent of everyone, therefore creating tensions and divisions will only lead to discontent and make our life harder.

Any external religious organization will be considered as a [foreign organization](#foreign-organizations).


## Travels

Getting in touch with different cultures is extremely important to broaden our vision of the world. By better understanding different cultures, it will be easier to relate with them, break misconceptions and foster collaboration. We trust that society will reach a level of well-being such as to be able to guarantee to each member a periodic visit to another country for at least one month a year.

It will be beneficial to set up organized travels, especially in countries where the language barrier could lead to problems, or in those having more stringent access regulations. That's said, each member must be given free choice on how to organize the trip as they see fit.

At first, the possibility of travel will likely be subject to [waiting lists](#waiting-lists), where those who have made fewer trips should have higher priority. During the distribution of resources it is always good to invest in this aspect.


## Children
The world we live in is vast and abundant in resources, but nothing is infinite. It is important to understand that greater the society size and greater the production processes must be to ensure that everyone can live a dignified life.

That's why we must be conscientious in having children.

The computer system gives us easy access to the total number of people present and also to the average age of each member, so a system could be set up to regulate birthrate based on a [waiting list](#waiting-lists). 

Unexpected pregnancy will be subject to a [rehabilitation program](#rehabilitation-programs) to better understand the importance of resources and protected sex. Obviously the pregnancy can be carried out without any repercussions. Abortion will also be an option and it will be up to the woman to decide, perhaps counseled by an expert.

Parenting is one of the most complex of all activities, that's why it will be very important for each new parent to periodically undertake [courses](#education) to better understand how they can support their child.
