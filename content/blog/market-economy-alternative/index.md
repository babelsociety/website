In this article we want to better understand what a market economy is, why we need an alternative and how it could look like.

We aim for a broad audience, hence we will try to explain all terms in a simple way, even though sometimes it doesn't abide to a more strict economic definition.

# What is a Market Economy?

A market economy is an economy that distributes good and services through a market. 

A market is composed by priced products, buyers and sellers.

In the scope of this article, we will define price as the monetary value you need to buy a product.

A product is anything that can be exchanged for money, such as goods, services and labor.

A buyer is a person or a group of people that want to exchange money for a given product sold in the market. They can freely decide what products to buy, their only limitation is the amount of money available.

A seller is a person or a group of people whose goal is to sell a product on the market for a profit. They can freely decide how to acquire the product and what to sell, even though in practice they are limited by the capital available and their environment.

Any person participating in a market economy will act as a seller when they acquire money, and as a buyer when they consume money.

Profit is when a seller exchange a product for more money they used to acquire it. Suppose that to produce 1kg of apples I spend $0.70, then if I sell it for $1.00, I'll net a profit of $0.30, that I can now use to buy something else.  
The profit aspect is very important, given that this is the only way in markets to let money flow and the keep the economy working.

In theory sellers can decided by themselves at what price sell their products, however  higher the price, less people will actually buy it.

This competition between producer and consumers is the so-called "law of supply and demand".

Demand is how many buyers want a given product.

Supply is how much of a given product is available on the market.

The law of supply and demand is pretty intuitive and states that when many people want the same product (high demand), then sellers can afford to sell at higher price.  
Vice versa, when there are more products than needed (high supply), seller will have to low price to be able to sell it.

Both demand and supply are influenced by many factors in real life. Imagine for example that a drought hit a coffee plantation, which will decrease the amount of available coffee and therefore raise prices. That's why prices in markets change through time.

Still, why should a seller low the price? It's because there is another competition going on, the one between sellers. A healthy market **needs** many competing sellers over the same product to ensure a fair price.

Market share in today economy is a big factor for profits. Given a product, the market share is how much a seller sold of it in proportion to the total amount. For example, if in total the market sold 100kg of apples, and a single seller managed to sell 30kg, then their market share would be 30%.

There are many factors that influence market share, economic often focus on price. Given two equivalent product, a smart buyer will buy the cheaper one, hence a lower price will give sellers a bigger piece of the pie. It may seems counter-intuitive, but the logic is that I can try to sell apples at 1$/kg, but then only sell 20kg and gain $20, or I can lower the price at 0.80$/kg, which will allow me to sell 30kg and gain $24, $4 more than before.

A third component a seller have to be aware of is the State and its regulations, such as regulations in the food industry that guarantees a certain level of security to buyers.

This brings us to the degree of freedom in a market. Higher the amount of regulations imposed by the State, less is the freedom. A free market is when there are no regulations at all and both sellers and buyers are the sole responsible for their actions in the market. This means that if a sellers goes bankrupt, the whole burden should be on them.  
The opposite extreme is a fully-regulated market where the State is in full control of sales and production.

A market economy is composed by many different markets with various degree of freedom. Think for example how different regulations applies to the labor market (more regulations) and the financial one (more freedom).

# Issues

Now that we have a good understanding of what markets are, we can explore the issues they create when applied to real life.

## Tendency to Monopolies

We have a monopoly when the market have only one single seller for a given product, meaning that their market share is 100%.

Remember that to keep prices under control, markets need a healthy competition between many sellers. Once such competition is removed, the single seller has free reign over the market. This gets even worse when they provide very important products, such as medicines, water and energy.

Big sellers can band together and form a de-facto monopoly through mergers, acquisitions or by forming a cartel. They don't even need 100% market share, as long as it is big enough. A common tactic is to push prices artificially low to the point they can even incur a small loss, which will push smaller sellers out of market given that they cannot compete anymore. Now that they have full control, they can raise prices and or low the quality of their products.

One infamous example is the [Phoebus Cartel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoebus_cartel).

Monopolies tend to be strictly regulated by many countries, however big businesses often find loopholes or ignore then until they are busted. See [Amazon hit with record US$1.3 billion fine for abuse of supply chain monopoly](https://techhq.com/2021/12/amazon-hit-with-record-us1-3-billion-fine-for-abuse-of-supply-chain-monopoly/) for a quick example.

This issue is particularly important because it reflects the limits of fierce competition. Even in an environment as strictly competitive as markets, **those who actually win the game**, raking the greatest profits, **do so through collaboration rather than competition**.

Given the chance, every business will have the tendency to band up with others because by doing so they solidify their power in the market.

## Markets don't measure societal value

We deem as successful a business that is capable of conquering a big market share and produce hefty profits for its owners.

This economic success doesn't equate to a business that is morally just, nor even ethical. Indeed, there are many economically successful businesses that are unethical and infamous for their exploitative malpractices.

Another example are the hedge-fund manager who earn hundreds times more than a nurse. We could debate on which job provide greater benefits to society, but we should all agree that the value provided by the manager will never be hundreds times more than the nurse.

Markets are simple tools that are bound to economic and that's it. Price in a market isn't synonym of societal value, only of market value, but we often conflate the two.

This is particularly dangerous when it comes to the idea of free markets. Markets if anything, incentivize competition over everything else, and when there is fierce competition the powerful will prey upon the weak. Slavery in the eye of markets economy is a good way to reduce costs and improve profits. Environmental regulations instead are a big nuisance because they increase costs, possibly cutting out profitable industries such as coal and oil extraction. There is no malice, only economy.

History, together with today labor market and climate crisis, teach us that we cannot be trusted when competition is on and our quality of life depends on it. We will exploit all that we can.

## Low-quality products

Because sellers must compete and price tends to be a big factor for market share, they have all the incentives to reduce selling price as much as they can. Every seller have an inherent cost of production that will inevitably eat on their profits, hence to lower the price they must also lower the cost of production.

The easiest way to reduce costs is by cutting on quality, which will allow you to produce more for less.

Cutting quality on goods is even better. If a seller introduce in the market a product that is very durable and can be easily repaired, after a while they will exhaust demand and thus reduce their profits.

This is why the [Phoebus Cartel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoebus_cartel) was instituted, why [planned obsolescence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planned_obsolescence) is inevitable, and why [repairing goods must be hard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_repair).

Another big issue created by low-quality goods is that they tend to create a lot of waste, have a bad environmental impact and waste precious resources.

This issue isn't limited to only physical goods, think for example about the majority of software programs that you use. Many of them are pretty bad because the business decided to cut on labor to produce or maintain it.

## Manipulation

We humans have a great record when it comes to exploit things, including ourselves. It is only natural that when our quality of life is at stake, people will nudge and push, trying to find the best way to exploit markets.

There are many way of doing it, we will go through the more evident ones.

### Demand manipulation

Advertisement is practically a way to manipulate buyers in preferring your product rather than another equivalent.

Consumerism is another way to push buyers into over-consumption of products. Through a degeneration of advertisement, now sellers try to instill in buyers an artificial need for their product, trying to effectively trick them into buying it. Originally, consumerism meant that buyers should drive production through expressing their needs, by "voting with their wallet", but this degenerated quite quickly.  
It isn't limited to ads, but it infiltrates our very own culture. For example, a classic cliché is for women to have many shoes and bags, many more that they need. This is often portrait as something good in films or other cultural events, until it becomes *natural* to have so many bags. Same did the tobacco industry with cigarette, portraying smoking as something "cool", something every "true man" uses.

Fashion is a face of consumerism. It manipulates buyers through our innate sense of community. We *need* to be part of a group, we *need* to feel socially included, hence they leverage these innate sentiments in buyers to let them buy specific products even though they don't need them. A classic cliché is for women to have way too many shoes and bags. They don't need as many, only sellers profits out of it.

Branding works similarly to fashion, but a strong one will also tap into loyalty and trust, allowing them to sell products at higher price than normal, distorting the law of supply and demand, raking in more profits than otherwise. Another subtle consequence of branding, is that people now have an innate distrust of brands they don't recognize, making it harder for new seller to enter the market.

The term "influencer" should ring an alarm bell, their job is to literally influence (read: trick you) into buying a product and they don't even hide it. 

Misinformation do play a big role in manipulating buyers. Tobacco industry once again comes to mind, and how much they underplayed the bad effects of nicotine and cigarettes. Another less known example is lead contamination, which was kept under the rug by big corporations through corruption of renowned scientists; today we are aware of it thanks to the great efforts of [Clair Cameron Patterson's campaign against lead poisoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clair_Cameron_Patterson#Campaign_against_lead_poisoning).

### Supply manipulation

Scalping is a way to manipulate the market to artificially limit the supply of a given product.

This very often happens with tickets for concerts or other entertainments, where a group of people buy tickets en mass as soon as they are available, possibly exhausting availability. After a while, they will put tickets on sale for a much higher price, netting a quick and nice profit.

This isn't limited to tickets though, we have seen this happening in the house market, but also cars and any other kind of limited edition goods.

From the economic point of view, this is a sound strategy: the original seller will cash in profits and move the burden on the scalpers, which also have a high chance of profits.

However, from a buyer perspective it can be quite frustrating. The high prices sometimes cannot be afforded, or people will have to fasten their belts. It is a socially immoral practice, but economically sound.

A way how powerful countries influence global supply of certain goods is by imposing austerity on weaker nations through debts, preventing them from subsidizing production of goods. On the other hand, these same powerful countries will subsidize their own economy, giving their sellers a sharp advantage in terms of price and thus win a bigger share in the global market. This is just an example of how markets can be manipulated through regulations.

### Financial manipulation

The whole finance market is one of the most unstable and prone to manipulation that let their perpetrator rake in extreme profits in a relatively short amount of time.

The stock market increase mostly due to speculation rather than creation of real value. We should always remember the [Wall Street Crash of 1929](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street_Crash_of_1929) and the [Financial crisis of 2008](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_crisis_of_2007%E2%80%932008).

Many of those manipulation are also used in the more recent crypto-currency market, such as the "pump & dump": a wealthy, big and organized group of buyers start buying lots of crypto and generate transactions to artificially increase the coin value (pump); once the price is high enough, it will attract more naïve people and allow the initial buyers to sell their cryptos for a big profit (dump). Those people who buy high may even be tricked to believe they are part of the "pump", while in all effect being victim of the dump.

When "[pump & dump](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pump_and_dump)" is combined with "[short selling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_%28finance%29)" we have the "[short squeeze](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_squeeze)", which recently caused quite some trouble to hedge-funds during the [Gamestop short squeeze](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GameStop_short_squeeze).

These are just two of the simplest examples, financial manipulations are increasingly sophisticated and can look as legit businesses until they explode.

Finance piggyback on top of all other markets, hence the worst part is that once it bursts, it will have a cascading effect on the whole economy and have serious repercussions even on those people that weren't directly involved.


## Hinder Progress

It is true that markets encourage people do things differently in the hope to win over the endless competition. This is the main argument used by market advocates to promote markets as the engine of innovation.

However, in a market economy, secrets are very important. If you happen to discover the formula for a satisfying sauce or drink, or perhaps a way to produce same quality product but in a more efficient way, then you will have a greater advantage in the market, bigger profits and therefore a better life for yourself.

Markets incentivize you to keep innovations for yourself as much as you can. Just think of China's silk production method or Coca-Cola (Coke) secret recipe; people have died to ensure it remained a secret.

However secrets hinder progress. By hiding information, by hiding a better way of doing something, you are *excluding* all others from possibly improving it even further.

This understanding is one of the reason why [patents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patent), and [intellectual property rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual_property) more broadly, have become more and more relevant in market economy.

A patent owner has the right, granted by the government, to *exclude* others from making any use of an invention, in exchange for the public disclosure of it. Thanks to patents, inventors can know grant use of the invention for a fee, while others can see how it works and possibly further innovate, spreading progress much faster they could do otherwise. If you want, it's paving the way to a mild form of collaboration.

Notice how the language used for patents is exactly the one of secrets: to *exclude* other people. Because keeping a secret is really hard, especially in an increasingly connected world, patents give you the same exclusion benefit of secrets, while avoiding all the hassle.

The initial intent behind patents may have been good, however they are becoming increasingly problematic and are once again hindering progress.

The scope of patents has broadened up, to the point that it has become much more difficult to come up with an innovation that doesn't infringe this or that patent. Furthermore, patents can be sold, hence many wealthy businesses understood that by racking in as many as possible, they can raise the barrier of entry for a given market even more. This is yet another way how sellers try to control a market.

Regulations tried to counter the hinder of progress in markets by creating a new way to exploit it.

Another reason why market economy hinder progress is because the social structure that derives from it could be disrupted by certain kind of innovation. Automation is one of the most important area for progress, but also one of the most dangerous to markets societies. The reason is simple: most people profits comes from waged labor; automation main goal is to *replace* human labor with machines, essentially cutting out participation in the market for hundreds of million of people. Most of these people will not be able to quickly find a new source of profits, creating a bad effect on the market economy at large.

We should never forget that markets do not exist in a bubble. What happens in markets will ultimately affect the life of real people, as we very well know. That's why automation in this context can't go full speed and instead have to be carefully threaded, even limited or delayed.

One important component of progress is failure. We need to try countless experiments, to deeply study nature, come up with different alternative design and formulae, before we can come up with something innovative and groundbreaking. In one word, we need research. All of these efforts and failure are rejected by markets. Markets is a tool to exchange products that self-optimize for profits; research and development is the exact opposite of it, given that we need to burn through quite some time and resources.

That's why in a society heavily built around markets, such as capitalism, progress will be further hindered by this aversion for research. Here we should understand that it isn't the fault of markets, but rather a problem of using the wrong tool, like trying to drive a nail with a screwdriver.

## Value Extraction

One of the golden rule of every market is "buy low, sell high" and this is the key to success. This logic predates stock markets and even capitalism, being in used at the dawn of markets.

The logic is self-explanatory: use an advantage that allows you to buy at low price, then sell to people at a weaker position for a higher price, raking in some nice profits. With "advantage" we mean it in the broad sense: it can be high capital that allow you to do something others cannot afford (eg: refine ore into metal), power bestowed by a role (eg: a shareholder negotiating a better price for another of their venture), or due to a trade secret (eg: silk production). As you can see, it can involve further processing of the initial product, hence you don't have to sell it in the original form. The weaker people are all those excluded by your advantage, who are therefore dependent on the more advantaged to provide that service.

Through their advantage they are effectively cutting out competition and extracting value from those who can't have access to it. A common example is waged labor: workers are employed by those with greater capital, but they will not benefit from the full fruits of their labor, otherwise the capital owner, whose only advantage is to have more capital, will not be able to make their own profit.
