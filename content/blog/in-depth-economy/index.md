In this article we will analyze more in depth how Babel Economy works, what problems we are trying to solve and why we decided on this solution.

# Managing Resources

In the words of French economist and politician Raymond Barre:

> _Economics is the science of managing scarce resources_. It examines the forms taken by human behavior in the management of these resources; analyzes and explains the ways in which an individual or a society allocates _limited means to the satisfaction of multiple and unlimited needs_.

The main goal of any economic system must be to efficiently manage scarce resources and at the same time keep under control our unlimited desires.

Managing is all about making decisions and setting up the right processes. Better the decisions we make, greater would be its efficiency.

**Greater the amount of information at our disposal, better decisions we will make.**

Now, let's talk about money. Many consider it as the corner stone of our society, essential to our very life.

It is an ancient invention, being already in use since at least the 1760 BC by the Babylonians.

Money did propel trade and commerce when it was first introduced, because it simplify it and allow for more complex transactions.

This simplification comes at a cost: all different resources are replaced by money in the decision process. We therefore **lose information**.

Until recently, it was beneficial because basing our calculation upon one single unit increased our overall capacity of making good decisions.


# Economic calculation problem

It doesn't matter what economic system is used, when we want to produce something it all boils down to inputs and outputs.

The method of production we choose will dictate what kind and how many resources we need as an input. After all the steps and transformations are successfully completed, we will end up with one or more output resources.

Here, when we say "resource" we intend it in the broadest sense: anything that can be produced or consumed. In this sense, wheat, flour and bread are all resources.

The issue is that there may be different ways of producing the same product that requires different inputs. Different resources have different intrinsic values that depends on two main factors: scarcity and usage; both depends on the vagaries of the environment.

Based on all of that, we thus need to decide which production method is best suited *to our particular condition*. The best decision in here can be the worst in there. The best decision of today, can be the worst of tomorrow. Such is the complexity of this choice.

This concept has been discussed at length and is known as "[Economic calculation problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_calculation_problem)". According to [Ludwig von Mises](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_von_Mises), markets together with money are the best tools to price products and thus allocate resources in the most efficient way.

Contrary to theory, in practice we still make very bad decision such as pollution, favor cheap goods despite being harmful, speculation, price manipulations, etc...

Not everyone agreed with von Mises, some people such as [Leonid Kantorovich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonid_Kantorovich) focused their work on [calculation in-natura](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculation_in_kind), aiming at a more centrally [planned economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planned_economy).

Despite their efforts, keeping track of all the different resources wasn't easy and even though this model give better results on a small set of resources, it isn't applicable on a large scale. Plus it aimed at a central authority.

A more modern attempt is [participatory economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participatory_economics), which is a form of distributed planned economy.
Even though it is more distributed, it still needs to know how much of each resource will be consumed in society, which in our opinion contrast the spontaneous nature of human beings and therefore it is unpractical.

# Track & Adapt

The strategy we want to propose is "track & adapt".

A first good guess on what method to use can be
