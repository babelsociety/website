In this article we will analyze more in depth how Babel Economy works, what problems we are trying to solve and why we decided on this solution.

# Managing Resources

In the words of French economist and politician Raymond Barre:

> _Economics is the science of managing scarce resources_. It examines the forms taken by human behavior in the management of these resources; analyzes and explains the ways in which an individual or a society allocates _limited means to the satisfaction of multiple and unlimited needs_.

The main goal of any economic system must be to efficiently manage scarce resources and at the same time keep under control our unlimited desires.

Managing is all about making decisions and setting up the right processes. Better the decisions we make, greater would be its efficiency.

**Greater the amount of information at our disposal, better decisions we will make.**

Now, let's talk about money. Many consider it as the corner stone of our society, essential to our very life.

It is an ancient invention, being already in use since at least the 1760 BC by the Babylonians.

Money did propel trade and commerce when it was first introduced, because it simplify it and allow for more complex transactions.

This simplification comes at a cost: all different resources are replaced by money in the decision process. We therefore **lose information**.

Until recently, it was beneficial because basing our calculation upon one single unit increased our overall capacity of making good decisions.


# Economic calculation problem

It doesn't matter what economic system is used, **when we want to produce something it all boils down to inputs and outputs**.

The method of production we choose will dictate what kind and how many resources we need as an input. After all the steps and transformations are successfully completed, we will end up with one or more output resources.

Here, when we say "resource" we intend it in the broadest sense: anything that can be produced or consumed. In this sense, wheat, flour and bread are all resources.

The issue is that there may be different ways of producing the same product that requires different inputs. Different resources have different intrinsic values that depends on two main factors: scarcity and usage; both depends on the vagaries of the environment.

Based on all of that, we thus need to decide which production method is best suited *to our particular condition*. The best decision in here can be the worst in there. The best decision of today, can be the worst of tomorrow. Such is the complexity of this choice.

This issue has been discussed at length and is known as "[Economic calculation problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_calculation_problem)". According to [Ludwig von Mises](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_von_Mises), markets together with money are the best tools to price products and thus allocate resources in the most efficient way.

Contrary to theory, in practice we still make very bad decision such as pollution, favor cheap goods despite being harmful, stark inequalities, price manipulations, etc...

Not everyone agreed with von Mises, some people such as [Leonid Kantorovich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonid_Kantorovich) focused their work on [calculation in-natura](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculation_in_kind), aiming at a more centrally [planned economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planned_economy).

Despite their efforts, keeping track of all the different resources wasn't easy and even though this model give better results on a small set of resources, it isn't applicable on a large scale. Plus it aimed at a central authority.

A more modern attempt is [participatory economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participatory_economics), which is a form of distributed planned economy.
Even though it is more distributed, it still needs to know how much of each resource will be consumed in society, which in our opinion contrast the spontaneous nature of human beings and therefore it is unpractical.

# Track & Adapt

Planned economy and market economy are poles apart, but let's see more in detail what happens in practice.

Suppose that we have a bakery focused on making bread. It so happens that wheat became a more important resource, so much and for enough time that now spelt flour may be a better candidate.

How can we arrive to a conclusion in the two different systems?

In theory, in market economy the price of wheat will increase to a point where we start looking for alternatives, that's when we find out that spelt flour is cheaper and change our production method. However, in practice as soon as the price of an input resource increases, producers will adjust the final good's price accordingly, hence it is the consumer that is burdened with finding a cheaper alternative. Still, the overall effect remains that more spelt bread will be consumed.

In a planned economy it is more complicated. We said wheat became more *important*, and if this is enough to raise price in market economy, it isn't for planned economy. Why is wheat more important? Is it due to a drought and so we have less than usual? Or perhaps we have found new applications for it, thus requiring more? Supposing there are new applications, are they actually more important than making bread?  
Planners must answer all these questions (and some more) to find out if changing production to more spelt bread is a good idea. Still, we should appreciate the fact that if they could answer, then there is a much greater chance to make a better decision. In practice though finding those answers for each and all variations is a great challenge.

They are very different processes, but if we squint our eyes enough, we may see a similar trend in both systems: those who decide must track how resources are evolving in their environment and then adapt accordingly.

This fundamental truth is what we call "track & adapt", and so far it is the only pragmatic way we have to conquer the complexity of production and distribution.

# Principles

We understand that an economic system doesn't exist in a bubble, it is influenced and does influence society at a whole. The two are inextricably bound, thus by aligned them, we ensure to create an overall system that will reinforce itself.

The most important condition we want to satisfy is: **the individual quality of life is strictly dependent to society quality of life**.

This concept is the corner stone of Babel society, as much as it is of its economy.

Under the economic light, such principle implies that products distribution and accessibility must be fair and unrelated from what the individual is capable of. Furthermore, it implies that salaries and wages cannot exist in this system, and same does private property of the production capital.

Because quality of life is strictly bound to how good resources are managed, another strong implication is that everyone will work hard to avoid wasting resources. Hence production will naturally gravitate towards high-quality, sustainable and long-lasting products.

We believe centrally planned economy is incompatible with the **decentralization** principle of Babel, while our **freedom of choice** does conflict with most decentralized planned economies.

# Economic system

During our quick analysis of the different available systems, we have reached 3 important conclusions:

* Money hide information, but good decisions rely on precise information
* Producers always know input and output resources
* Every system, no matter how different, will need to track and adapt resources based on their environment

The first focus is "track". All producers will track down all the resources that they consume and produce, same will do consumers. All of these information will be freely available to all members in Babel through a decentralized computing system. Such system will give us a clear vision of what is available in the society, what are the different trends and project future needs.

Whenever we must choose a production method, we can query the system to see how much resources are currently available, who produce what and where, etc...

All of these information are sufficient to make a first educated guess. Considering that production change with time, nailing it down at the start is not needed, but rather the process will be refined through time and experience. More importantly, such experience can be shared in the community as a whole, helping others starting a new, similar production line.

Suppose that we are some bread-enthusiast that loves the flavor of sourdough bread when it gets cooked in a stone oven. After a quick check, we see that there is no shop in the area, hence we decide it is time to open one. We query the system for what grain is available in our area and turns out there is plenty of wheat; then we check for wood and come up with a good location where to open it.

Notice that in this example we had clear in mind from the get-go what production method to use. In a society where people are free to follow their interests, it is natural to use a method that best align with our tastes even though it isn't the most efficient from production point of view.

Remember that resources should be used to satisfy *our unlimited desires*, hence we will argue that the most economical efficient method isn't the cheaper one, but rather **the method that is most gratifying and satisfying**.

We know what to do and open a [project](@/manifesto/index.md#projects) to take care of the overall supply chain and justify it. People in the area are quite happy to have such a shop, giving more strength 

Once we decide the method, we will now what input resources we need and are ready to open a new [project](@/manifesto/index.md#projects) to take care of the overall supply chain and justify such an effort. This route is similar to a planned economy given that through the project the new production line and its implications may be analyzed in great detail. However it is much more spontaneous than planned economy because there is no master-plan, but rather it happens as a reaction in the environment.

In the project many different scenario may come up, for example we may decide that this new product is so essential and important to society that we are ok with reducing capacity in some other area. We could realize that it isn't worth it, or that another production method better align with what is available. What's important is that discussing about it with other people will give us better clarity around it, increase overall information and thus improve resource management efficiency.

Once the project is approved, we will have assigned all the capital we need, from machinery to buildings, and it will include the initial group of people that will take part on it. We will have all it needs to make it a success.




The strategy we want to propose is "track & adapt".
