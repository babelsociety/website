# Managing resources

In the words of French economist and politician Raymond Barre:

> _Economics is the science of managing scarce resources_. It examines the forms taken by human behavior in the management of these resources; analyzes and explains the ways in which an individual or a society allocates _limited means to the satisfaction of multiple and unlimited needs_.

The main goal of any economic system must be to efficiently manage scarce resources and at the same time keep under control our unlimited desires.

Managing is all about making decisions and setting up the right processes. Better the decisions we make, greater would be its efficiency.

**Greater the amount of information at our disposal, better decisions we will make.**

Consider that resources are limited, and each can be employed for different production goals. For example, on a piece of land we could build a house, a skyscraper, a supermarket, or perhaps use it to farm grains, fruit trees, leave it to nature, etc...

The best way to distribute resources should tell us what's the configuration that best satisfy as much of our unlimited desires. Because desires are unlimited, we already know that we will never fully satisfy them, hence we need to prioritize as much as possible, the result of which will be different based on the culture of the people that are part of the society we are interested in. We all know food is important, but different cultures appreciate different flavors, hence different foods will be prioritized differently. Based on geography, we may need extremely different clothing, build buildings using different techniques, etc...

As if all of this wasn't complex enough, our needs and desires are always changing: what's important today may be useless tomorrow. Thus, whatever distribution we find, it will always be a fleeting approximation.

The best resource allocation method is one that can be applied often and give us enough satisfaction.

This issue has been discussed at length and is known as "[Economic calculation problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_calculation_problem)".

We will now briefly discuss how allocation is handled in the two most discussed economic models: market economy and planned economy.

We will use three examples to better compare the two models with Babel economy: buy a chef knife, open a bakery and reaction to wheat shortage.

# Allocation in Market Economy

[Ludwig von Mises](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_von_Mises) was the first to discuss about the economic calculation problem. According to him, markets together with money are the best tools to allocate resources.

He spoke about capitalism, but his thoughts can be extended to [market economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_economy) as a whole. In this economic model, resources are exchanged in markets using money as the means of exchange.

All resources are owned by someone according to some agreement and to them is given the right to sell those resources for as much money as they see fit. How the amount is decided is out of scope, it suffice to understand that all resources will have an associated amount of money, called "price".

All people in society will try to maximize their satisfaction through markets, which in this model translates in making the most profit out of each exchange.

The price is very important because it acts as a signal of what is best, a thread to follow. Money **hides complexity** and simplify all those complex information in a way we can handle.

## Example 1: Buy a chef knife

A knife produced by a skilled artisan will be of much higher quality when compared to a knife that is mass produced using cheap raw materials, hence the first one will be sold at a higher price. 

As a consumer, we can compare the two knives by the tag price and assume that the first one is of higher quality and, supposing we can afford it, choose it.

Is this always a good choice? No, it isn't. The expensive knife my require greater maintenance and because we need it just to prepare some quick meals, it would be better to buy the cheaper, low-maintenance version.

Suppose there are two knives of equivalent quality, but one is produced locally while the other is shipped from far away. In this case, the first one will be cheaper because it doesn't need to pay for long-distance transportation, hence the right choice is to buy the locally produced one.

However in the first case price cued us about quality, hence we may wrongly assume that the imported knife is better and buy it even though it isn't. We may also be tricked into the wrong choice by other factors, to name a few, packaging, branding and advertisement.

It should be clear now how hiding information doesn't come for free. The act of hiding disconnect buyers from the actual product, so much that when we look at two products the only information truly available is its price. In theory price should encompass all the nuanced desires present in society, but in practice it is so easy to influence and manipulate that it has no meaning.

It is natural for people to search for more information when buying something, and higher the relative price, greater will be the research effort.

That's why advertisement is all about giving people the *most appealing* information: an environmentalist will be happy to buy vegetables produced through ecologically friendly techniques, even though the price is much higher than it should be.

Advertisement however will never tell buyers if the production of a product involved exploiting child labor, poisoning rivers, burning forests, and all the worst acts you can think of. Price will hide all of it, rendering the buyer a blissful ignorant, that will happily buy dangerous and unethical products just because they are cheap or trendy.

In the end looking at just the price, as Mises suggested, doesn't tell us much of the story. Price may help us decide, but we still need to gather a good deal of qualitative information if we want to make the right choices and thus reach an efficient allocation.

## Example 2: Open a bakery

If we want to open a bakery in a market economy, the first thing we need to do is understand what are all the products we need and how are these products currently priced in the market. We may have an idea of what kind of production method we want to use, and perhaps explore the ingredients needed to produce different kind of bread products.

We will start by looking for a location to setup our shop, evaluate if it would be better to rent a place or buy it, then we will need to build up our network to meet up with the producers that can give us a steady supply of all those goods that we need to bake our bread, such us different kind of flour, salt and perhaps water. We will need to reach out to a marketing agency to come up with a catchy store sign and perhaps prepare an event for the opening to attract more customers.

We will find different suppliers and different locations that may be suitable to our needs, each with their own perks, issues and costs. We will note all information available, including the different prices.
Lastly we will sum all prices up and figure out if we can actually afford it. Unless we are already rich, we will need to ask a bank for a loan. The bank will do its due diligence and if we don't look good enough, they may decide to decline the loan and our efforts will be in vain. Suppose we are lucky, we will then adapt our plan based on the money the bank is willing to give us.

**Available money is the ultimate constraint that will dictate the feasibility and initial quality** of our shop in a market economy.

Once we start, **our sustenance will be strictly bound to how much profit we can extract from our bakery**, hence we need to sell for a profit and employ all possible strategies to ensure this venture, and thus our very life, goes well.

Unless we start with a lot of money or have a particularly strong network, opening a business more complex than that, like a widget factory, is almost impossible in market economy due to the prohibiting upfront costs.

## Example 3: Wheat shortage

Suppose that this year society is hit by a wheat shortage. If we are lucky to live in a sensible society, there is probably wheat stashed away in view of such a disruption.

In market economy prices will raise up, but by just a small percentage until wheat supply go back to normal levels, and so life go by as usual.

Another scenario that is plausible in that those who can afford will buy way more wheat than they need, making the shortage even worse. This is what a speculation is: we *invest* now expecting we will make more money in the future. This future profit is the so-called ROI: "return of investment".

Such practice will indeed raise the price of wheat faster than it should, allowing the speculators to sell it back at higher price and make a nice, easy profit.

The impact on society can be quite bad. Higher the price of wheat, fewer people will be able to access all those products that depends on it. Considering that this is a primary good, the impact can be severe.

Whenever there is a raise in price of an input (i.e: a product used to produce other products), the common behavior is for producers to increase the price of their products accordingly. Going back back to the bakery example, if the cost of wheat increase by 10%, we will just increase all our products by 10%. Our customers will decide what's best for them and if the new price is still ok.

Once the price increases too much, more and more customers will look for an alternative, and perhaps decide to start buying spelt bread. Those bakeries that already produce spelt bread will see a raise in profits, while those who don't will need to quickly adapt their supply to meet the change in demand. Those who don't adapt, risk to go bankrupt.

The greater demand will also increase the price of spelt flour, hence it is possible for those bakeries that don't have a strong network to be out of the game.

Another consideration is that the first to be affected will be people with low income, and so bakeries in low-income areas will have to be quick to adapt. In richer areas bakeries may keep producing wheat bread, strong that their costumer will buy it even at the increased price.

As you can see, **luck is a strong element in market economy**: all businesses influenced by spelt will see an increase in profits without having done anything different than before, while does in rich areas stay safe thanks to their privileged position.

Because more and more people will shift to spelt-based products, the demand for wheat-based products will decrease and the price will follow. Speculators will have to sell the remaining grains very fast, otherwise they may incur in a loss rather than a profit. Information and market understanding, plus some luck, is essential for speculations: once the price goes down it's already too late.

If shortage last for long and price stay high, more farmers will replace part of their production to wheat, hoping to increase their profits. If too many people do that, supply may increase too much and many will incur a loss. Those who lost money will then replace wheat for something else, supply and demand will be closer and price will fluctuate again. 

In theory, a market can reach a point of equilibrium where demand is exactly equal to supply, meaning that all the wheat produced is consumed but no more. Due to all the influences in society, equilibrium is never reached.

Through this example we can see how all the **decisions of different individuals, devoid of any external coordination, will come together** an drive the market in a certain direction, **adapting to the vagaries of their environment and contrasting desires**.

# Allocation in Planned Economy

[Planned economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planned_economy) was popularized by the socialist movement. It may be centralized or decentralized, but in both cases the goal is to create an economic-wide plan to enact in a certain time-span.

An economic-wide plan states what the society commits on producing and thus consuming: from shoes to bombs, all should be in the plan. Once the time-span elapsed, a new plan is made taking in consideration all the changes happened in society and how well we did in the previous one.

The centralized version is what Mises strictly criticized when he came up with the economic calculation problem. This version indeed doesn't scale given that the amount of information necessary is way to big to be managed by just a limited group of people.

Special mention goes to [Leonid Kantorovich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonid_Kantorovich) who pioneered and focused on [calculation in-natura](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculation_in_kind), coming up with the linear programs as a possible way to solve the allocation problem in an algorithmic way. The understanding that we can optimize production efficiency under certain conditions through the use of an algorithm is very important, however it solves only one aspect of resources allocation given that we still need to know *what* and *how much* to produce.

The decentralized planned economy is more interesting. All people will contribute to the plan, increasing the amount of knowledge available and thus increasing its feasibility. We will focus on [participatory economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participatory_economics) in particular.

In participatory economics (parecon from now on), we still have a price that it is decided according to the plan. The economic power of each individual is based on how much they are willing to *sacrifice*. During planning, an average amount of *sacrifice* is established, then everyone who decide to sacrifice more than that will be better compensated and vice versa.

Sacrifice in parecon is based on the amount of hours worked on what kind of activity. Hazardous jobs such as a mining will be graded higher and thus we can work fewer hours to reach the average sacrifice.

Another important aspect is that jobs will be distributed in such a way that every person can experience different position and kind of works. In each period, a mix of administrative and more manual jobs should be handed out.

This arrangement should guarantee a more homogeneous wealth distribution.

## Example 1: Buy a chef knife

During planning phase we will have to communicate to our neighborhood that we want a knife, specifying also why we need it and possibly the quality of it.

According to how the plan goes, we may renounce to it to keep more of a different products, but supposing society as a whole have enough capacity to produce it, then our desire will be granted and the knife delivered once the next period starts and whenever it is ready.

Depending on how much the knife we are interested into is valued, we may also decide to work more in this year to be able to afford them.

Even though our wish is granted, there is a slight chance we will not receive the knife. For example, there is a sudden war in a country and metals supply is cut down. It doesn't matter how good is a plan, there is always the chance for it to go wrong, especially those with a big time-span.

Admittedly, this isn't an big problem given that we can ask for it again next time.

Something unclear in parecon is what happens if a good is so expensive that doesn't matter how much we sacrifice, we will probably can't afford it, such as a new car or a nice piano. It is also unclear if we can accumulate wealth.

All in all, buying the right knife is much more straightforward then in market economy, given that nobody wants to profits from our ignorance.

## Example 2: Open a bakery

## Example 3: Wheat shortage

Even if the wheat shortage happens after the plan is already




Despite their efforts, keeping track of all the different resources wasn't easy and even though this model may give better results on a small set of resources, it isn't applicable on a large scale. Plus it employed a central authority, which severely limits the freedom of all members in a society.

A more modern attempt is [participatory economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participatory_economics), which is a form of distributed planned economy.
Even though it is more distributed, it still needs to know how much of each resource will be consumed in society, which in our opinion contrast the spontaneous nature of human beings and therefore it is unpractical.

A lot of ink has been consumed in discussing how to best distribute resources in a society, of particular interest is the "[Economic calculation problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_calculation_problem)".

We will now have a look at the two most discussed ways, that are somehow opposed in their nature: market economy and planned economy.


Now, let's talk about money. Many consider it as the corner stone of our society, essential to our very life.

It is an ancient invention, being already in use since at least the 1760 BC by the Babylonians.

Money did propel trade and commerce when it was first introduced, because it simplify it and allow for more complex transactions.

This simplification comes at a cost: all different resources are replaced by money in the decision process. We therefore **lose information**.

Until recently, it was beneficial because basing our calculation upon one single unit increased our overall capacity of making good decisions.


# 

It doesn't matter what economic system is used, **when we want to produce something it all boils down to inputs and outputs**.

The method of production we choose will dictate what kind and how many resources we need as an input. After all the steps and transformations are successfully completed, we will end up with one or more output resources.

Here, when we say "resource" we intend it in the broadest sense: anything that can be produced or consumed. In this sense, wheat, flour and bread are all resources.

The issue is that there may be different ways of producing the same product that requires different inputs. Different resources have different intrinsic values that depends on two main factors: scarcity and usage; both depends on the vagaries of the environment.

Based on all of that, we thus need to decide which production method is best suited *to our particular condition*. The best decision in here can be the worst in there. The best decision of today, can be the worst of tomorrow. Such is the complexity of this choice.

This issue has been discussed at length and is known as "[Economic calculation problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_calculation_problem)". According to [Ludwig von Mises](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_von_Mises), markets together with money are the best tools to price products and thus allocate resources in the most efficient way.

Contrary to theory, in practice we still make very bad decision such as pollution, favor cheap goods despite being harmful, stark inequalities, price manipulations, etc...

Not everyone agreed with von Mises, some people such as [Leonid Kantorovich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonid_Kantorovich) focused their work on [calculation in-natura](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculation_in_kind), aiming at a more centrally [planned economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planned_economy).

Despite their efforts, keeping track of all the different resources wasn't easy and even though this model give better results on a small set of resources, it isn't applicable on a large scale. Plus it aimed at a central authority.

A more modern attempt is [participatory economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participatory_economics), which is a form of distributed planned economy.
Even though it is more distributed, it still needs to know how much of each resource will be consumed in society, which in our opinion contrast the spontaneous nature of human beings and therefore it is unpractical.

# Track & Adapt

Planned economy and market economy are poles apart, but let's see more in detail what happens in practice.

Suppose that we have a bakery focused on making bread. It so happens that wheat became a more important resource, so much and for enough time that now spelt flour may be a better candidate.

How can we arrive to a conclusion in the two different systems?

In theory, in market economy the price of wheat will increase to a point where we start looking for alternatives, that's when we find out that spelt flour is cheaper and change our production method. However, in practice as soon as the price of an input resource increases, producers will adjust the final good's price accordingly, hence it is the consumer that is burdened with finding a cheaper alternative. Still, the overall effect remains that more spelt bread will be consumed.

In a planned economy it is more complicated. We said wheat became more *important*, and if this is enough to raise price in market economy, it isn't for planned economy. Why is wheat more important? Is it due to a drought and so we have less than usual? Or perhaps we have found new applications for it, thus requiring more? Supposing there are new applications, are they actually more important than making bread?  
Planners must answer all these questions (and some more) to find out if changing production to more spelt bread is a good idea. Still, we should appreciate the fact that if they could answer, then there is a much greater chance to make a better decision. In practice though finding those answers for each and all variations is a great challenge.

They are very different processes, but if we squint our eyes enough, we may see a similar trend in both systems: those who decide must track how resources are evolving in their environment and then adapt accordingly.

This fundamental truth is what we call "track & adapt", and so far it is the only pragmatic way we have to conquer the complexity of production and distribution.

# Principles

We understand that an economic system doesn't exist in a bubble, it is influenced and does influence society at a whole. The two are inextricably bound, thus by aligned them, we ensure to create an overall system that will reinforce itself.

The most important condition we want to satisfy is: **the individual quality of life is strictly dependent to society quality of life**.

This concept is the corner stone of Babel society, as much as it is of its economy.

Under the economic light, such principle implies that products distribution and accessibility must be fair and unrelated from what the individual is capable of. Furthermore, it implies that salaries and wages cannot exist in this system, and same does private property of the production capital.

Because quality of life is strictly bound to how good resources are managed, another strong implication is that everyone will work hard to avoid wasting resources. Hence production will naturally gravitate towards high-quality, sustainable and long-lasting products.

We believe centrally planned economy is incompatible with the **decentralization** principle of Babel, while our **freedom of choice** does conflict with most decentralized planned economies.

# Economic system

During our quick analysis of the different available systems, we have reached 3 important conclusions:

* Money hide information, but good decisions rely on precise information
* Producers always know input and output resources
* Every system, no matter how different, will need to track and adapt resources based on their environment

The first focus is "track". All producers will track down all the resources that they consume and produce, same will do consumers. All of these information will be freely available to all members in Babel through a decentralized computing system. Such system will give us a clear vision of what is available in the society, what are the different trends and project future needs.

Whenever we must choose a production method, we can query the system to see how much resources are currently available, who produce what and where, etc...

All of these information are sufficient to make a first educated guess. Considering that production change with time, nailing it down at the start is not needed, but rather the process will be refined through time and experience. More importantly, such experience can be shared in the community as a whole, helping others starting a new, similar production line.

Suppose that we are some bread-enthusiast that loves the flavor of sourdough bread when it gets cooked in a stone oven. After a quick check, we see that there is no shop in the area, hence we decide it is time to open one. We query the system for what grain is available in our area and turns out there is plenty of wheat; then we check for wood and come up with a good location where to open it.

Notice that in this example we had clear in mind from the get-go what production method to use. In a society where people are free to follow their interests, it is natural to use a method that best align with our tastes even though it isn't the most efficient from production point of view.

Remember that resources should be used to satisfy *our unlimited desires*, hence we will argue that the most economical efficient method isn't the cheaper one, but rather **the method that is most gratifying and satisfying**.

We know what to do and open a [project](@/manifesto/index.md#projects) to take care of the overall supply chain and justify it. People in the area are quite happy to have such a shop, giving more strength 

Once we decide the method, we will now what input resources we need and are ready to open a new [project](@/manifesto/index.md#projects) to take care of the overall supply chain and justify such an effort. This route is similar to a planned economy given that through the project the new production line and its implications may be analyzed in great detail. However it is much more spontaneous than planned economy because there is no master-plan, but rather it happens as a reaction in the environment.

In the project many different scenario may come up, for example we may decide that this new product is so essential and important to society that we are ok with reducing capacity in some other area. We could realize that it isn't worth it, or that another production method better align with what is available. What's important is that discussing about it with other people will give us better clarity around it, increase overall information and thus improve resource management efficiency.

Once the project is approved, we will have assigned all the capital we need, from machinery to buildings, and it will include the initial group of people that will take part on it. We will have all it needs to make it a success.




The strategy we want to propose is "track & adapt".

A first good guess on what method to use can bes.
