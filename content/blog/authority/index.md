In this article we analyze the concept of authority, how it works, what it needs, how it relates to manipulation and how it differs from leadership.

We define authority as "the power to command others". There are different degrees of authority: greater it is and more commands we will be able to give. Absolute authority means that we have full control over a person, and that they will execute our commands without doubt. Masters have absolute authority over their slaves.

This definition may be confused with manipulation. Indeed, through perfect manipulation we can have full control over a person and let them do whatever we want, however there is an important difference. Manipulation is *to trick* another person *without them realizing*. Authority instead *requires* the other person to *recognize* and *accept* our role as a ruler.

The manipulator's power comes from themselves, from their personal ability to trick other people.  
**The authority's power comes from others, from their awake willingness to follow the received commands.**

How is it possible that a person decide to follow what another commands? Don't they value freedom and free will?

There are several reasons. A common argument is that people don't like to think much and rather prefers to let others decide for them. Even though there may be a tiny minority *naturally* inclined to being commanded, it isn't enough to justify how prevalent it is nowadays.

Given the chance, the majority of people would prefer a position of power rather than receiving commands.

Authority stems from a generalized and subtle manipulation that begins as soon as a child start to be conscious of the world around them.

The first instance of authority is the one instilled by their parents. We have been persuaded that we must whip our children into shape for their own good. Indeed, children don't have the mental capacity to understand certain concepts, and ensuring they follow the parents' command is *the easiest way* to prevent them from messing up.

But is it the *best* way? Through our education we have instilled in them the main ingredient of authority: obedience. We taught them that it is ok to mindlessly follow commands, and they shouldn't question them nor even think about them. Even more, if they aren't an obedient child, then they are a *bad* child. It is a short-sighted solution with grave repercussions.

We should differentiate between leadership and authority. Leadership is the *ability* to *guide* other people. It is often confused with authority, but they couldn't be more different. Authority presuppose that *subjects* follow *commands*, while a leader *guide* their *fellows* towards what they believe is the right direction. Followers listen to the leader because they understand and trust them, but they are free and encouraged to express their dissent, without fear of repercussions.

Leadership main responsibility is to inform and listen, to teach and give the good example to those who follow. When authority must appear unbreakable and absolute, leadership can be humane and flexible.

Authority is strictly hierarchical, there is a sharp social and material distinction between those who rule and those who are ruled. The easiest way to gain authority is by having someone in a position of power bestow it upon us, that's how you climb the ladder. If you ever worked in a big company, you will surely be familiar with this.

Leadership cannot be imposed, but rather must be gained. **Leaders are chosen by the group**, must gain their trust through good deeds and recognized talents.

With authority, if subjects perceive they can seize the position of power for themselves, they will try hard to do so, no matter what. That's why authority must not be challenged, any form of dissent destroyed as soon as possible. **Authority forms an antagonistic relationship with its subjects**.  

Effective **leadership accepts mistakes and trust followers** to point them out, it is a symbiotic relationship. We are in these together and together will move on.

Hence we can *lead* our children, we can explain them *why* we ask them certain things in a way they can understand, to instill *trust* while *empowering* them to explore the world in a more secure way. It is true that this is much harder and more time consuming than obedience, but nonetheless we strongly believe it is a better approach.

Anyway, the next step in the child's education is school. Here again we submerge them in the teacher and school system's authority. Once they are done, it is time for either the military or the workplace. In both cases they are subject to an even greater authority than before, because their life now depends on it.

The greatest authority of them all, the one that dominates our life from the get-go, is the government and its law.

Our whole life, at multiple levels of consciousness, is shrouded in obedience, thus it's only natural that parents, who are themselves subject to authority, will pass it down without thinking twice on it. For most of us, obedience is as natural as breathing and there is no alternative.

And yet we said that it is the subject who gives power to the ruler. By just this definition, it would suffice and always possible for the subject to refuse the command, to break the mind-numbing straitjacket of obedience and exert their freedom.

Rulers are aware of this weakness, that's why compliance is ensured through a sophisticated web of psychological and physical chains, forged and refined throughout the centuries.

Authority first line of defense is the fear of what it could be. We are taught that those who don't follow the rules lose their status as humans, only to be punished and rejected by society as a whole.

It then makes clear all the punishments if we break our obedience: we would lose our job, perhaps never be able to find another one or forced to change industry; or we may lose our freedom, confined in a run-down, insalubrious prison, wasting our life away.

If fear isn't enough, rulers do all they can to delivered what was promised, perhaps even more. It is common in dictatorships to torture and ultimately kill the dissenters. The more vicious the punishment, better the effect.

One fundamental gear to make everything work is to atomize us: every person to themselves. We shouldn't be bothered if our neighbor die from hunger as long as we eat. This is one of the reason why capitalism is so esteemed by authority. It is the same compartmentalization used in boats: by dividing we ensure that even if someone pierce through authority's frame, others will stay put, keep obey our commands and help "repair" the hole.

Punishments work up to a certain point, they brew resentment and violence call violence.

Authority cunningly present itself as benevolent, it will reward us when we comply because it knows that more comfortable are its subjects, stronger will be its grip. Repeat what we teach and you will get good grades. Get good grades and we'll put you in a good college. Go to a good college and we'll give you a good job. Get a good job, obey your masters and you'll have a great life. Those who follow the rules will found great happiness. Some try to push this as the true reason to be alive, *go figure*.

More you have to lose, greater the fear of losing it. Why should you dissent and risk everything? Is it such a *big deal* to kill a stranger when *we* could destroy your family instead? Why all the fuss on fabricating this report when you could lose your job and become poor? [Don't you see how much in discomfort they are?](@/blog/systemic-poverty/index.md) Do you *really* want to be part of it? Just live in your nice house and shut up.

Hence, we are left with any other option but to comply. That's the tremendous effect of powerful authority. It will use all weapons at its disposal to crush the will of its subjects.

And yet, it is its subjects who give it power. It is its subject that torture the dissenter. It is its subject who pull the trigger. It is its subject who ostracize one from finding another job. It is its subject who teach obedience to their own children.

**It is always the subjects, never the rulers**.

One person is powerless, but rulers are people too. A lone master is as powerful as a lone slave.

One person is powerless, but if many people awaken and come together to protest, to help each others bare the backlashes that could come, to show people how fragile and weak authority really is, then we *can* and *will* break free.

**Organized people are the greatest might of any society**.

Our main effort must be to create a safe-zone, an armor for the ruled that can withstand the backslashes of the masters. Without it, any effort will be quickly stifled by authority's power.

Education is also extremely important. Instead of obedience, let's hand down free will to our children; that's the only way we can ensure a brighter future.

One last, but important consideration is that while forging our new path, we must be very cautious of leadership.

**Authority is a corrupted form of leadership**. The first leaders had good reasons to be, but as soon as they got too much power and benefits, corruption was inevitable. It is much better to let every person think for themselves and contribute to decisions, and if leadership still finds its way, then it should be applied only in particular context and always for the shortest time-span.

Once more, **we must foster free will and active involvement** instead of passive agreement. We must move away from the "hero" archetype.

We have a long, harsh road ahead, but *together* we can overcome any ordeal. Together we can reach a better future.
