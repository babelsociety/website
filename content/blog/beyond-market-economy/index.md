In this article we want to better understand what Market Economy is, why we need an alternative and how it could look like.

We aim for a broad audience, hence we will try to explain all terms in a simple way, even though sometimes it doesn't abide to a more strict economic definition.

# What is Market Economy?

A Market Economy is an economy that distributes good and services through a market. 

A market is composed by priced products, buyers and sellers.

For sake of simplicity, we will define price as the monetary value accepted to buy a product.

A product is anything that can be exchanged for money, such as goods, services and labor.

A buyer is a person or a group of people that want to exchange money for a product sold in the market. They can freely decide what products to buy, their only limitation is the amount of money available.

A seller is a person or a group of people whose goal is to sell a product on the market for a profit. They can freely decide how to acquire the product and what to sell, but they are limited by the capital available and their environment.

Any person participating in a market economy will act as a seller when they acquire money, and as a buyer when they consume money.

Profit is when a seller exchange a product for more money they used to acquire it. Suppose that to produce 1kg of apples I spend $0.70, then if I sell it for $1.00, I'll net a profit of $0.30, that I can now use to buy something else.  
The profit aspect is very important, given that this is the only way in markets to let money flow and the keep the economy working.

In theory sellers can decided by themselves at what price sell their products, however higher the price, less people will buy it.

This competition between producer and consumers is the so-called "law of supply and demand".

Demand is how many buyers want a given product.

Supply is how much of a given product is available on the market.

The law of supply and demand is pretty intuitive and states that when many people want the same product (high demand), then sellers can afford to sell at higher price.  
Vice versa, when there are more products than needed (high supply), sellers will have to low price to be able to sell it.

Both demand and supply are influenced by many factors in real life. Imagine for example that a drought hit a coffee plantation, it will decrease the amount of available coffee and therefore raise prices. That's why prices in markets change through time.

Still, why should a seller low prices? It's because there is another competition going on, the one between sellers. A healthy market **needs** many competing sellers over the same product to ensure a fair price.

Market share in today economy is a big factor for profits. Given a product, the market share is how much a seller sold of it in proportion to the total amount. For example, if in total the market sold 100kg of apples, and a single seller managed to sell 30kg, then their market share would be 30%.

There are many factors that influence market share, economic often focus on price. Given two equivalent product, a smart buyer will buy the cheaper one, hence a lower price will give sellers a bigger piece of the pie. It may seems counter-intuitive, but the logic is that I can try to sell apples at 1$/kg, but then only sell 20kg and gain $20, or I can lower the price at 0.90$/kg, which will allow me to sell 30kg and gain $27, $7 more than before.

A third component a seller have to be aware of is the State and its regulations, such as regulations in the food industry that guarantees a certain level of security to buyers.

This brings us to the degree of freedom in a market. Higher the amount of regulations imposed by the State, less is the freedom. A free market is when there are no regulations at all and both sellers and buyers are the sole responsible for their actions in the market. This means that if a seller goes bankrupt, the whole burden should be on them.  
The opposite extreme is a fully-regulated market where the State is in full control of sales and production, such as the military.

A market economy is composed by many different markets with various degree of freedom. Think for example how different regulations applies to the labor market (more regulations) and the financial one (more freedom).

There are different flavors of market economies, such as [capitalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalism), [market socialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_socialism) and [mutualism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutualism_%28economic_theory%29). All of them share the fundamental aspect we have discussed, but differ in how society is built around it.

# Issues: an overview

Now that we have a good understanding of what Market Economy is, we can explore the issues it creates when applied to real life.

## Killing competition

In a Market Economy one of our main objective is to kill competition, and if we manage to do so we will be in a position of monopoly, which is the most profitable outcome in a Market Economy.

We have a monopoly when the market have only one single seller for a given product, meaning that their market share is 100%.

Remember that to keep prices under control, markets need a healthy competition between many sellers. Once such competition is removed, the single seller has free reign over the market. This gets even worse when they provide very important products, such as medicines, water and energy.

Big sellers can band together and form a de-facto monopoly through mergers, acquisitions or by forming a cartel. They don't even need 100% market share, as long as it is big enough. A common tactic is to push prices artificially low to the point they can even incur a small loss, which will push smaller sellers out of market given that they cannot compete anymore. Now that they have full control, they can raise prices and or low the quality of their products.

One infamous example is the [Phoebus Cartel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoebus_cartel).

Monopolies tend to be strictly regulated in many countries, however big businesses often find loopholes or ignore it until they are busted. See [Amazon hit with record US$1.3 billion fine for abuse of supply chain monopoly](https://techhq.com/2021/12/amazon-hit-with-record-us1-3-billion-fine-for-abuse-of-supply-chain-monopoly/) for a quick example.

This issue is particularly important because it reflects the limits of fierce competition. Even in an environment as strictly competitive as markets, **those who actually win the game**, raking the greatest profits, **do so through collaboration rather than competition**.

Given the chance, every business will have the tendency to band up with others because by doing so they solidify their power in the market and can greatly increase their profits.

## Markets don't measure societal value

We deem as successful a business that is capable of conquering a big market share and produce hefty profits for its owners.

This economic success doesn't equate to a business that is morally just, nor even ethical. Indeed, there are many economically successful businesses that are unethical and infamous for their exploitative malpractices.

Another classic example is the hedge-fund manager who earn hundreds times more than a teacher. We could debate on which job provide greater benefits to society, but we should all agree that the value provided by the manager will never be hundreds times more than the teacher.

Markets are simple tools that are bound to economic and that's it. Price in a market isn't synonym of societal value, only of market value, but we often conflate the two.

This is particularly dangerous when it comes to the idea of free markets. Markets if anything, encourages competition over everything else, and when there is fierce competition the powerful will prey upon the weak. Slavery in the eye of Market Economy is a good way to reduce costs and improve profits. Environmental regulations instead are a big nuisance because they increase costs, possibly cutting out profitable industries such as coal and oil extraction. There is no malice, only economy.

History, together with today labor market and climate crisis, teach us that we cannot be trusted when competition is on and our quality of life depends on it. We will exploit all that we can to improve our immediate conditions, despite the problems we may incur in the future.

## Low-quality products

Because sellers must compete and price tends to be a big factor for market share, they have all the incentives to reduce selling price as much as they can. Every seller have an inherent cost of production that will inevitably eat on their profits, hence to lower the price they must also lower the cost of production.

The easiest way to reduce costs is by cutting on quality, which will allow you to produce more for less.

Cutting quality on physical goods is even better. If a seller introduce in the market a product that is very durable and can be easily repaired, after a while they will exhaust demand and thus reduce their profits.

This is why the [Phoebus Cartel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoebus_cartel) was instituted, why [planned obsolescence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planned_obsolescence) is inevitable in a market economy, and why [repairing goods must be hard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_repair).

Another big issue created by low-quality goods is that they tend to create a lot of waste, have a bad environmental impact and waste precious resources.

This issue isn't only limited to physical goods, think for example about the majority of software programs that you use. Many of them are pretty bad because the business decided to cut on labor to produce or maintain it.

## Manipulation

We humans have a great record when it comes to exploit things, including ourselves. It is only natural that when our quality of life is at stake, people will nudge and push, trying to find the best way to exploit markets.

What follows is in now way an exhaustive list, we will just see some examples to get an idea around it.

### Demand manipulation

Advertisement is practically a way to manipulate buyers in preferring your product rather than another equivalent one.

Consumerism is another way to push buyers into over-consumption of products. Through a degeneration of advertisement, now sellers try to instill in buyers an artificial need for their product, trying to effectively trick them into buying it. Originally, consumerism meant that buyers should drive production through expressing their needs, by "voting with their wallet", but this degenerated quickly.  
It isn't limited to ads, but it infiltrates our very own culture. Think of what the tobacco industry did with smoking: they portrayed it as something "cool", something every "true man" does, until it became *natural* and part of our culture.

Fashion is a face of consumerism. It manipulates buyers through our innate sense of community. We *need* to be part of a group, we *need* to feel socially included, to feel special in some way, hence they leverage these innate sentiments in buyers to let them buy specific products even though they don't need them. A classic cliché is for women to have way too many shoes and bags. They don't need as many, only sellers profits out of it.

Branding works similarly to fashion, but a strong one will also tap into loyalty and trust, allowing them to sell products at higher price than normal, distorting the law of supply and demand, raking in more profits than otherwise. Another subtle consequence of branding is that people now have an innate distrust of brands they don't recognize, making it harder for new seller to enter the market.

The term "influencer" should ring an alarm bell, their job is to literally influence (read: trick you) into buying a product and they don't even hide it. 

Misinformation do play a big role in manipulating buyers. Tobacco industry once again comes to mind, and how much they underplayed the bad effects of nicotine and cigarettes. Another less known example is lead contamination, which was kept under the rug by big corporations through corruption of renowned scientists; today we are aware of it thanks to the great efforts of [Clair Cameron Patterson's campaign against lead poisoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clair_Cameron_Patterson#Campaign_against_lead_poisoning).

### Supply manipulation

A common example of supply manipulation is scalping, a way to manipulate the market to artificially limit the supply of a given product.

This very often happens with concerts tickets, where a group of people buy tickets en mass as soon as they are available, possibly exhausting availability. After a while, they will put tickets on sale for a much higher price, netting a quick and nice profit.

This isn't limited to tickets though, we have seen this happening in the house market, but also cars and any other kind of limited edition goods.

From the economic point of view, this is a sound strategy: the original seller will cash in profits and move the burden of sale on the scalpers, which also have a high chance of profits.

However, from a buyer perspective it can be quite frustrating. The high prices sometimes cannot be afforded, or people will have to fasten their belts. It is a socially immoral practice, but economically sound.

Markets can be manipulated even at the global level. A way how powerful countries influence global supply of certain goods is by imposing austerity on weaker nations through debts, preventing them from subsidizing production of goods. On the other hand, these same powerful countries will subsidize their own products, giving their sellers a sharp advantage in terms of price and thus win a bigger share in the global market. This is also an example of how markets can be manipulated through regulations.

### Financial manipulation

The whole financial market is one of the most unstable and prone to manipulation that let their perpetrator rake in extreme profits in a relatively short amount of time. Truth to be told, not all market economies must include a financial market, but capitalism which is the most wide-spread as of today, heavily rely on it.

The stock market increase mostly due to speculation rather than creation of real value. We should always remember the [Wall Street Crash of 1929](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street_Crash_of_1929) and the [Financial crisis of 2008](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_crisis_of_2007%E2%80%932008).

Many of those manipulation are being revamped in the more recent crypto-currency market, such as the "pump & dump": a wealthy, big and organized group of buyers start buying lots of crypto and generate transactions to artificially increase the coin value (pump); once the price is high enough, it will attract more naïve people and allow the initial buyers to sell their cryptos for a big profit (dump). Those people who buy high may even be tricked to believe they are part of the "pump", while in all effect being victim of the dump.

When "[pump & dump](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pump_and_dump)" is combined with "[short selling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_%28finance%29)" we have the "[short squeeze](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_squeeze)", which recently caused quite some trouble to hedge-funds during the [Gamestop short squeeze](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GameStop_short_squeeze).

These are just two of the simplest examples, financial manipulations are increasingly sophisticated and can look as legit businesses until they explode.

Finance piggyback on top of all other markets, hence the worst part is that once it bursts, it will have a cascading effect on the whole economy and have serious repercussions even on those people that weren't directly involved.

### Regulations

All regulations introduced in a market will in some way distort it and therefore manipulate it. Free-markets are immune to this given that by definition they are free from regulations and rather trust buyers and sellers to do the right thing.

Even though some regulations have positive social effects (think of laws that abolish child labor), legislators of any Market Economy can certainly be corrupted to introduce regulations that will favor some sellers and penalize others.

For example, insurance markets are greatly boosted by regulations, given that States makes many of them mandatory and in some cases will appoint only a specific group of businesses as eligible.

## Hinder progress

It is true that markets encourage people do things differently to win over the endless competition. This is the main argument used by market advocates to promote markets as the engine of innovation.

However, in a market economy, secrets are very important. If you happen to discover the formula for a satisfying sauce or drink, or perhaps a way to produce same quality product but in a more efficient way, then you will have a greater advantage in the market, bigger profits and therefore a better life for yourself.

Markets encourage you to keep innovations for yourself as much as you can. Just think of Ancient China's silk production method or Coca-Cola (Coke) secret recipe; people have died to ensure it remained a secret.

There is no doubt that secrets hinder progress. By hiding information, by hiding a better way of doing something, you are *excluding* all others from possibly improving it even further.

This understanding is one of the reason why [patents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patent), and [intellectual property rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual_property) more broadly, have become more and more relevant in capitalist market economy.

A patent owner has the right, granted by the government, to *exclude* others from making any use of an invention, in exchange for the public disclosure of it. Thanks to patents, inventors can know grant use of the invention for a fee, while others can see how it works and possibly further innovate, spreading progress much faster they could do otherwise. If you want, it's paving the way to a mild form of collaboration.

Notice how the language used for patents is exactly the one of secrets: to *exclude* other people. Because keeping a secret is really hard, especially in an increasingly connected world, patents give you the same exclusion benefit while avoiding all the hassles.

Even supposing a benevolent initial intent behind patents, today they are becoming increasingly problematic and are once again hindering progress.

The scope of patents has broadened up, to the point that in some industries it is quite difficult to come up with an innovation that doesn't touch on this or that patent. Furthermore, patents can be sold, hence many wealthy businesses understood that by racking in as many as possible, they can raise the barrier of entry for a given market even more. This is yet another way how sellers try to control a market.

Regulations tried to counter the hinder of progress in markets by creating a new way to exploit it.

Another reason why Market Economy hinder progress is because the social structure that derives from it could be disrupted by certain kind of innovations. Automation is one of the most important area for progress, but also one of the most dangerous to markets societies. The reason is simple: most people profits comes from waged labor; automation main goal is to *replace* human labor with machines, essentially cutting out participation in the market for hundreds of million of people. Most of these people will not be able to quickly find a new source of profits, creating a bad effect on the Market Economy at large.

We should never forget that markets do not exist in a bubble. What happens in markets will ultimately affect the life of real people, as we very well know. That's why automation in this context can't go full speed and instead have to be carefully threaded, even limited or delayed.

One important component of progress is failure. We need to try countless experiments, to deeply study nature, come up with different alternative design and formulae, before we can come up with something innovative and groundbreaking. In one word: research. All of these efforts and failure are rejected by markets. Markets is a tool to exchange products that self-optimize for profits; research and development is the exact opposite of it, given that we need to burn through quite some time and resources without any guarantees on possible profits.

That's why in a society heavily built around markets, progress will be further hindered by this aversion for research. Here we should understand that it isn't the fault of markets, but rather a problem of using the wrong tool, like trying to drive a nail with a screwdriver.

# Issues: the root cause

All the issues so far discussed stems from a single design decision that all variations of Market Economy abide to: **an individual's quality of life is strictly bound to how good of a seller they are**.

Let's analyze what it means.

Remember that in a market economy the main way to earn money is through selling products in the market. For the majority of people it is their own labor and time, while for others can be what their factories produce, what their shop sold, etc...

More we manage to profit from the products we sell, greater will be the amount of money we can spend. Remember further that as a buyer our main limitation is the amount of money owned, hence greater the amount, higher the quality and quantity of products we will have access to. Ultimately, better access to products translate to a better life overall, both at material and social level.

Most human beings (if not all) will strive to maximize their quality of life and their survival. That's one of the innate trait we have, hence it is by this design that competition arise as the king of markets, further exacerbating our egoism and individualism. Indeed, there is no incentive in helping a complete stranger doing better in life, but rather it is the opposite: by penalizing others we have a greater chance to succeed.

It is, in our opinion, a ruthless design choice that gave birth to the ruthless world we now live in. Today societies often fall in the meritocracy pitfall, believing that *some deserve to have more*, and that through markets we can best assert it.

Even [Friedrich Hayek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Hayek), known economist, philosophers and passionate advocate of free-markets, recognized at his time that there is no moral deserts in how much one will profit in a market. In *Constitution of Liberty*, Hayek wrote:

> There is little a man can do to alter the fact that his special talents are very common or exceedingly rare. [...] the value which a person's capacities or services have for us and for which he is recompensated has little relation to anything that we can call moral merit or deserts.

# An alternative: Babel Economy

We have already discussed at length how Babel Economy looks like in the article "[In Depth: Babel Economy](@/blog/in-depth-economy/index.md)".

As a quick reminder, Babel Economy is strictly decentralized and does use markets to distribute products, however there is no money and consumption is free under certain limits based on each product and environment constraints.

We will now see how it is different than Market Economy. The single, most important design decision is that in Babel **the quality of life of an individual is strictly bound to the quality of life of the society as a whole**.

Society's quality of life is in turn bound to all the effort poured in by its individual members. This setup creates a virtuous positive feedback loop where to improve our life we will actively and indirectly improve the life of everyone else. We use our natural egoism to our advantage.

In this model collaboration is way more important and effective than fierce, ruthless competition.

We will know see how Babel Economy tackles the issues we have analyzed in Market Economy.

## Healthy competition

In Babel Economy, even though the main driver is collaboration, there will still be competition going on. Given that it is a fully decentralized society without any central authority, competition will naturally arise whenever there are two different ways of doing something. 

Because the best solution will ultimately benefit the whole society, there is no need to kill one over the other, but rather it is much better to experiment, let those who believe in each solution work on it and see which one will ultimately prevail.

It is probable that the competing solution will yield better results in different aspects and that in time will cross-pollinate to then generate a different, better solution.

The most important aspect is that this will be a form of healthy competition, where the main goal isn't to prove *yourself* at all costs, but rather **prove and improve the solution**.

## Focus on societal value

In Market Economy society abide to market rules, but this relationship is inverted in Babel: it is society that drives and decides on what the market should provide.

Because there is no profit in Babel's markets, production will be strictly bound to the value delivered to society, both material and moral.

For example, there is no way slavery could be established and nobody of sane mind would pollute the river they rely on. Replacing oil and coal in favor of more green and sustainable source of energy will be actively researched and promoted, because this will increase everyone quality of life.

This system is **designed to** promote all those activities that **improve society** rather than profits.

## Better products

No profits and no money means that production will be much more sensible on how resources are consumed. 

**There is no need for infinite growth**, which is physically unsustainable as demonstrated by all the global issues we have to face today and that sinisterly loom over our future.

In Babel we are encouraged the exact opposite behavior: produce less and enjoy each product much more.

In this system designing products that are environmentally sustainable, durable and repairable is essential, hence planned obsolescence and single-use products have no reason to exist.

## Market manipulation is worthless

All forms of manipulation exist to let few people reap greater rewards while penalizing others. In Babel there is no reason to penalize nor favor anybody, hence all manipulations are worthless.

The only relevant one may be demand manipulation, but it is unclear why we should spend so much effort in tricking people on using a particular product given that we will have no reward out of it.

Advertisement and algorithmic marketing will be important, but as a service rather than a manipulation. Instead of helping sellers reap greater profits, advertisement will help buyers sift through products, getting to know the new ones and chose according to their real preferences.

## Foster progress

In Babel, if an inventor decide to keep a new invention secret, he will damage the society as a whole, thus negatively impacting the overall quality of his own life.

The best way for inventors to improve their life is to spread theirs innovations as much possible as possible. Giving other people access to all the bits and bolts of each invention increases the chance to further improve it, or perhaps use it as a base for a completely new one. This is yet another positive feedback loop that will propel progress in society.

Because quality of life is completely unrelated from what we do as a job, there is no reason to restrain innovation in any field that could be beneficial to society. Indeed, automation will be one of the most interesting field to advance: people will try hard to avoid labor they don't like to do, finding novel ways to offload it to machines.

Automation will serve the whole society, affecting only those fields that we aren't interested in pursuing, such as in factories and other repetitive tasks, while those we enjoy, such as cooking, designing and painting, will probably be devoid of it or perhaps enhanced by it. Even during the transition phase, if so happens that one have pride in a line work that is being automated, they will be free to keep doing it in parallel with the machines. **Efficiency, though important, should never be more important than people**.

The most gifted of us will be able to focus on research to their heart content. We expect Babel to be thriving with research, one where full-on collaboration spiced by competition will yield the best results.

# Conclusion

The issue with Market Economy isn't the use of markets, but rather the intrinsic and systemic ruthlessness at its core. The more socialist form of it mitigate the issue, but it is there nonetheless.

*In theory* it is possible to build a good society based on Market Economy, but it is such an unstable system that it is hard to keep it up. We have seen times and times again in the last two centuries the struggle needed to stabilize it. We had some prosperous, yet short period of balance, that inevitably degenerated into a worse society, including the one we live in today. It is a Sisyphean struggle.

We have presented a better alternative, one that is much more stable thanks to its virtuous cycles, but by no means we want to affirm it is "the true and only way". Still, it is a way. A pragmatic, possible way that will systematically solve many of the issues that we all face in our day-to-day life. It isn't a perfect way, only a better one. It will have its own challenges and risks, but we can learn and further improve as we go.

There is no "end of history". History doesn't end. Change is inevitable, but not all changes are good, it can always change for the worse.

It is paramount for the people of today to **act** and **strive** for a better tomorrow. Tomorrow will always come, it is up to us to stir it towards the right direction.
